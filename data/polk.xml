        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>
                    <name type="person">James K. Polk</name> presided over four years of rapid scientific
          innovation. New technologies transformed the ways Americans preserved and disseminated
          information. Daguerreotypists captured the earliest known photographs of the White House
          and the earliest that survive of a sitting president. <name type="person">Polk</name> used
          an ancestor of the photocopier to duplicate his outgoing letters. Railroads crisscrossed
          the land and steamboats sped through the water. The first <abbr>U.S.</abbr> postage stamp
          enabled Americans to pay to send, rather than to receive, their mail.<note place="foot" n="1">On photography, see <name type="person">Clifford Krainik</name>, “A ‘Dark Horse’

        <p>Few inventions impacted Americans’ lives as much as the telegraph. <name type="person">Samuel F. B. Morse</name> had demonstrated his electrical system of communication in
            <date when="1838">1838</date>. After receiving a federal grant in 1843, he built a
          forty-mile line between Baltimore and the nation’s capital. The first major news item
          conveyed through the completed line, in <date when="1944-05">May 1844</date>, was <name type="person">Polk</name>’s nomination by the Democratic party for the presidency. <name type="person">Morse</name> and other entrepreneurs proceeded to lay lines across the
            country.<note place="foot" n="2">

        <p>For the first time in history, humans could communicate instantaneously beyond the range
          of sight or sound. <name type="person">Polk</name> telegraphed federal appointments as far
          as <name type="place">Illinois</name> and <name type="place">Kentucky</name>.<note place="foot" n="3">See, herein, <name type="person">Polk</name> to <name type="person">Joseph Lane</name>, <date when="1848-08-21">August 21, 1848</date>; <name type="person">Polk</name> to <name type="person">William L.

          could direct military <pb/>activities from the White House to an unprecedented
            degree.<note place="foot" n="4">See, for example, <name type="person">Thomas

        <p>Today, too, is an age of technological revolution. Our computers, smartphones, and
          Internet lie many inventive steps beyond the fanciest devices of the <date when="1840">1840</date>s. Much like the telegraph and the penny press, though, they enable us to

          in <date when="1848">1848</date>, had entered a “great Era of Improvement.”<note place="foot" n="6">

            <name type="person">James K. Polk</name> Project enters the twenty-first century.</p>
        <p>Between <date when="1958">1958</date> and <date when="2017">2017</date>, the <name type="person">Polk</name> Project produced thirteen hardcover volumes of the <hi rend="italics">Correspondence of <name type="person">James K. Polk</name>
                    </hi>.
          Published by <name type="org">Vanderbilt University Press</name> and, since <date when="1993">1993</date>, the <name type="org">University of Tennessee Press</name>, they
          render accessible <name type="person">Polk</name>’s incoming and outgoing letters from
          July <date when="1817">1817</date> to March <date when="1848">1848</date>. No longer do
          students, scholars, or history enthusiasts need to obtain Library of Congress microfilm,
          travel to other libraries and archives, contact private collectors, decipher faint
          handwriting, and research people and topics mentioned in letters. Thousands of transcribed
          and annotated letters, plus summaries of all other known extant correspondence, can be
          found on a single bookshelf.</p>
        <p>Now we go further. Working with Newfound Press, the digital imprint of <pb/>the <name type="org">University of Tennessee Libraries</name>, the <name type="person">Polk</name>
          Project is making the eleventh president’s letters even easier to find. As of January
            <date when="2016">2016</date>, the first twelve volumes of the <hi rend="italics">Correspondence</hi> are available, at no charge to the user, at <ref target="http://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_polk/">http://trace.tennessee.edu/utk_polk/</ref>. (They also can be found through our project
          website, <ref target="http://polkproject.utk.edu">http://polkproject.utk.edu</ref>.)
          Volume 13, only recently published in hardcover, will join them in late <date when="2018">2018</date>. These <abbr>PDF</abbr> volumes include all contents of the hardcover ones,
          plus they are full-text searchable. Users can download them to any device with access to
          the World Wide Web.</p>
        <p>The volume you are now reading represents a step further still. Work continues on Volume
          14 of the <hi rend="italics">Correspondence</hi>, which will complete the series. In the
          meantime, as we prepare that volume’s annotation and letter summaries, we see no
          reason not to share the transcriptions. Here you can read 104 letters that <name type="person">Polk</name> wrote and 260 that he received between <date when="1848-04-01">April 1, 1848</date>, and his death on <date when="1849-06-15">June 15, 1849</date>.
          They contain few notes, chiefly describing the texts, identifying enclosures, and citing other Polk letters referenced. But they
          are accurate, carefully proofread reproductions of the primary documents.</p>
        <p>
                    <name type="org">Newfound Press</name> publishes this early edition of <hi rend="italics">Correspondence of <name type="person">James K. Polk</name>

                    </hi>, with
          sophisticated technology to maximize its usability and sustainability. Not only are the
          letters on this <abbr>XML</abbr>-based website easily navigable, searchable, and
          copy-and-paste friendly. They also are encoded, by Backstage Library Works under Newfound
          Press’s direction, according to the standards of the Text Encoding Initiative
            (<abbr>TEI</abbr>). <abbr>TEI</abbr>, since its publication in <date when="1994">1994</date>, has become a widely accepted set of guidelines <pb/>for the presentation
          of texts in digital format. The standard used by publishers, libraries, museums, and
          scholars, it ensures the continued usability and consistent presentation of <name type="person">Polk</name>’s letters both across devices and applications and over time
          as technology develops.</p>
        <p>We hope you enjoy our most advanced digital product to date. Thanks to the generosity of
            <name type="org">Newfound Press</name> and of the <name type="person">Polk</name>
          Project’s sponsors, this electronic volume is—and will remain—completely free to the user.
          Historians and others can begin learning from these important documents of the final year
          of <name type="person">Polk</name>’s administration and his three-month retirement. We,
          meanwhile, are hard at work preparing the annotations, briefs, and calendar for the
          complete Volume 14, to be published by the <name type="org">University of Tennessee
            Press</name> and, later, by <name type="org">Newfound Press</name>. That volume also
          will include a calendar summarizing letters from earlier periods that we have located
          since publishing their chronologically appropriate volumes. Soon the <hi rend="italics">Correspondence of <name type="person">James K. Polk</name>
                    </hi>, with all the
          annotations and supplementary materials that readers have come to expect, will be
          complete in both print and digital formats.</p>
        <p>So please dive in. The letters on this site help to illuminate the aftermath of the
          Mexican War, including <name type="person">Polk</name>’s unsuccessful effort to establish
          territorial governments for the lands acquired from <name type="place">Mexico</name>; the
          election of <name type="person">Polk</name>’s successor, in which Whig and <name type="place">Mexican War</name> general <name type="person">Zachary Taylor</name>
          defeated Democrat and <name type="person">Polk</name> friend <name type="person">Lewis
            Cass</name>; and renewed concern over <name type="person">Polk</name>’s having misled
          senators in <date when="1845">1845</date> about his intentions regarding <name type="place">Texas</name> annexation. They discuss the heated debate over slavery in the
          United States, the spreading <pb/>revolutionary activity in <name type="place">Europe</name>, and American interest in purchasing <name type="place">Cuba</name>.
          Correspondents include California gold seekers, India’s poet laureate, and the wives of
            <name type="person">John Quincy Adams</name> and <name type="person">Robert E.
            Lee</name>. <name type="person">Polk</name> exchanged personal letters with friends and
          relatives including three of his siblings; his nephew and ward; and his wife, <name type="person">Sarah Childress Polk</name>. Letters from the last months of his
          presidency and from his brief retirement address the final illness and the anticipated
          legacy of one of the most consequential presidents in <abbr>U.S.</abbr> history.</p>

        <p>The current editor of the <hi rend="italics">Correspondence of <name type="person">James
              K. Polk</name>
                    </hi> has, in most regards, retained the editorial policies of his
          predecessors. Beginning with Volume 12, however, the editors have modified policies to
          enhance completeness, conciseness, or clarity. The guiding purpose has remained the clear
          and accurate presentation of <name type="person">Polk</name>'s correspondence.</p>
        <p>This digital volume consists of selected letters transcribed in full and annotated, to a
          limited extent, with endnotes. I define <name type="person">Polk</name>'s correspondence
          as all letters written by or to him. These include circulars (letters sent to multiple
          recipients) and notes (letters written in the third person), but not other documents sent
          by mail (such as newspaper clippings, meeting proceedings, or bills). I do not include
          anything published in <name type="person">James D. Richardson</name>'s <hi rend="italics">Compilation of the Messages and Papers of the Presidents</hi> or any reports published
          in <name type="person">John Bassett Moore</name>'s <hi rend="italics">Works of James
            Buchanan</hi>; though some of these messages and reports begin with a date and
          salutation, they are letters in form only and can be found in those volumes.<note place="foot" n="1">The volumes of those series covering the months included in this
            volume are <name type="person">James D. Richardson</name>, ed., <hi rend="italics">A

                </p>
        <p>This early edition of Volume 14 differs from the letterpress volumes not only in its
          digital format but also in the absence of most annotation and of <pb/>summaries of
          unpublished letters. Those will appear in the final hardcover and digital editions.
          Annotation herein is restricted to information about the texts and, where necessary to
          avoid confusion, very limited context. Endnotes provide neither identifications of people
          and topics nor full names for people mentioned in letters. As always, though, readers can
          assume that a reference to "Polk" in the annotation is to <name type="person">James K.
            Polk</name>. In the annotation I refer to the war fought by the United States and Mexico
          by the succinct term that <name type="person">Polk</name> and many of his correspondents
          used, "the Mexican War."</p>
        <p>In general, the editor and the editorial assistant have transcribed the letters
          faithfully with a strict regard for original spelling, punctuation, capitalization, and
          text placement. To improve clarity and to accommodate the demands of printed and digital
          type, however, we have yielded to a few standard rules of normalization. We have
          capitalized initial words of sentences and supplied sentence-ending punctuation if
          sentence divisions are clear; if sentence divisions are unclear, we have indicated so in
          notes. If a word in a manuscript can be read with equal ease as either the conventional or
          an unconventional spelling, we have transcribed it as the former. Similarly, if a word's
          capitalization is ambiguous, we have followed conventional upper- or lower-case usage. We
          have incorporated authors' interlineations and cancellations into the texts without
          comment, except where an explanation or the retention of struck-out text (in brackets) is
          necessary for readers' comprehension. Unintentional consecutive word repetitions have been
          omitted.</p>
        <p>We have transcribed short dashes on the base of the line as commas or <pb/>periods where
          the authors used them as such. We have ignored redundant punctuation and meaningless
          flourishes or ink marks. We have brought superscripts down to the line and transcribed
          markings beneath or beside superscripts as periods. We have omitted punctuation following
          the abbreviations "st," "nd," "rd," and "th"; punctuation after "s" if an author used it
          with every plural noun; and punctuation after a letter's date or signature. We have
          replaced colons or flourishes used to end abbreviations or initials with periods. We have
          standardized quotation marks, using double marks for a quotation and single marks for a
          quotation within a quotation, and have placed periods and commas before closing quotation
          marks. We have replaced nonstandard punctuation (such as a comma below a dash) with the
          most similar punctuation available that retains the author's meaning. Underlined text is
          represented by italics.</p>
        <p>Regardless of their position in the manuscript, we have set a letter's salutation and its
          place and date of composition on one line (or more if necessary) immediately below the
          letter's heading. In a letter written over two days, the second date appears at its place
          in the manuscript. Except in rare cases where they are particularly illuminating, we have
          omitted complimentary closings; an ellipsis at the end of a letter indicates a closing
          that either appears in the manuscript's final paragraph or, though positioned separately,
          continues the final sentence of that paragraph. We have rendered each author's signature
          in capitals and small capitals on its own line, but have placed the signature to a
          postscript in upper- and lower-case letters at the end of the last paragraph of <pb/>the
          postscript. We have omitted professional titles that follow signatures. We have set each
          postscript at the end of its letter; a note indicates if it appears elsewhere in the
          manuscript.</p>
        <p>Most of the transcriptions are based on extant letters held in archives or private
          collections. In rare cases, they derive from publications of letters or from original
          manuscripts of which the project has obtained copies but whose current locations are
          unknown. Three letters in this volume were originally written in languages besides
          English. The only version of a German letter that has been found, though, is the English
          translation that was presented to <name type="person">Polk</name> and is transcribed
          herein. For the French and Spanish letters that the president received, I publish English
          translations by French historian <name type="person">Margaret Cook Anderson</name> and by
          Mexican War historian <name type="person">John C. Pinheiro</name> and myself.</p>
        <p>Each letter's headnote includes the physical description and location of the version
          transcribed, along with identifications of other known extant versions or publications of
          the letter. We have noted the city or other location to which a published letter was
          addressed, whether written inside the letter or on its cover-the envelope if one was used
          or the exterior of the folded letter if one was not-in the headnote; we have noted
          probable addresses for letters whose covers are missing. Also in the headnote, we have
          included information from the recipient's or another's endorsement if it adds to readers'
          understanding of the letter (<name type="person">Polk</name> and his secretaries often
          summarized letters on their covers, but we generally have not included those summaries).
          In two cases, where <name type="person">Polk</name> wrote an important endorsement in
          letter form, we have <pb/>transcribed it in full above the headnote. We have quoted, in
          the headnote, the author's notation of "private" or other such stipulation; this text is
          from the top of the letter unless otherwise indicated. We have included delivery
          information such as the names of couriers, but mentioned postmarks only if they reveal
          significant information such as a delay in mailing or the route of an international
          letter.</p>
        <p>Brackets within a letter indicate text that we have inserted to complete a probable
          meaning, text whose transcription is uncertain, cancelled text that we have retained, or
          text that we have transcribed from a different version of the letter. A note indicates the
          nature of the bracketed text. The letters include many errors and unconventional
          spellings; bracketed text to complete meanings, or notes with corrected spellings, have
          been inserted only where confusion is likely otherwise. Bracketed ellipses indicate text
          that is illegible, usually owing to damage, archival tape, or poor ink transfer in <name type="person">Polk</name>'s copy press; a note indicates the problem. Brackets also
          surround supplied places or dates of composition (if omitted from or incorrectly stated in
          a manuscript), supplied signatures (if omitted from or cut out of a manuscript), and
          supplied postscript headings.</p>
        <p>Although this volume contains relatively little annotation, in crafting it I have
          consulted numerous primary and secondary sources. These include many well-known reference
          books and monographs. To ensure accuracy, only facts for which I have at least one
          reliable primary source or two reliable secondary sources have been included. Owing to
          these considerations and pursuant to <pb/>my desire that, in the final edition of the
          volume, the notes not overwhelm the letters, I have foregone the naming of sources in the
          notes except in rare cases where confusion may result otherwise.</p>
        <p>Letters often refer to other letters to or from <name type="person">Polk</name>. In
          general, readers may find such letters in this series. Some remain to be summarized for
          the final edition of this volume. I have noted if a mentioned letter has not been found.
          If an author refers to a letter in this series without giving the correspondent and date,
          I have supplied that information.</p>
        <p>I have identified in notes, with archival locations, all documents enclosed within
          letters published in this volume. Notes also indicate enclosures mentioned in the
          correspondence that have not been found. A letter's headnote indicates if the letter is
          itself an enclosure. I include notes for enclosed objects only if they have been found;
          most have not.</p>

        <salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>I have received your letter of the <date when="--02-22">22nd of February</date>,
          requesting leave of absence, for a short period in order to enable you to visit the United
          States. Upon conferring with <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Buchanan</name>
          </hi> I had determined to accede to your wishes, and would have done so, but for the
          sudden revolution which has occurred in France. That great event, renders, it highly
          necessary, if not indispensible, that all our diplomatic representatives in <name type="place">Europe</name>, should remain at their posts, that they should
          <pb/>vigilenty watch, its effects upon the Governments to which they are respectively
          accredited, their policy in reference to it, and that they should keep their own
          Government regularly &amp; minutely informed, of whatever may transpire. For these reasons
          I have felt constraind to decline accepting a request made by <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Ingersoll</name>
                    </hi> to be recalled from St. Petersberg.<note place="foot" n="1">
                        <name type="person">Ralph I. Ingersoll</name> requested his recall in
            Ingersoll to <name type="person">Polk</name>, <date when="1848-02-11">February 11,
              1848</date>. He also did so in a <date when="1848-02-11">February 11</date> dispatch,
            no. 8, to <name type="person">James Buchanan</name>. <abbr>LS</abbr>, duplicate, in
              <name type="person">Colin M. Ingersoll</name>’s hand. <abbr>DNA</abbr>–<abbr>RG</abbr>
            59. <name type="person">Buchanan</name> relayed <name type="person">Polk</name>’s denial
            of the request in a letter of April 1. <hi rend="italics">WJB</hi>–8, pp. 38–39.</note>
          If in the course of the next summer the condition of affairs in <name type="place">Europe</name> should be such as to permit it, it will give me pleasure, to grant the
          leave which you ask. At present I do not think that the U. States should be without a
          Diplomatic Representative of the first rank, at <hi rend="italics">Berlin</hi>.</p>
        <p>The news of the sudden overthrow of the French Monarchy, and the establishment of a
          Provisional Government, based on Republican principles, in its stead, has been received

        <p>In pursuance of the recommendation contained in my last annual messag[e]<note place="foot" n="1">Text here and below cut off side of page.</note> Congress has made
          the necessary appropriation fo[r] the outfit and salary of a charge d' affaires of the
          United States to the Papal <pb/>States. Imm[e]diately after the act was passed, it gave me
          pleasure to nominate you to the Senate for t[his] important mission, and the nomination
          wa[s] promptly confirmed by that body. You will receive your commission and instructions
          by th[e] Steamer which will convey to you this letter. [In] view of the great events,
          which have just transpi[red] in France, and of the advance of liberal princip[les] in
          other countries of <name type="place">Europe</name>, it is desireable that you should
          proceed to Rome and enter upon the duties of your mission with the least practicable
          delay. Being the first diplomatic rep[re]sentative of your country, accredited to the
          Pope's Government, your duties, will be delicate and highly important. The United States
          recognizes the Government to which you are sent, as that of one of the States of <name type="place">Europe</name>, with which it is proper to initiate Diplomatic relations,
          but without any reference to the fact that the Sovereign is also the Head of a church.
            <name type="person">
                        <hi rend="italics">Queen Victoria</hi>
                    </name> is also the Head of
          church. More detailed instructions than those which the Secretary of state has had time to
          prepare, during the brief interval which has elapsed, since, your nomination was confirmed
          by the Senate, will be forwarded to you by the next steamer for <name type="place">Europe</name>. After your arrival at your post, and after you have been recognized as
          the Representative of your Government, I deem it important, that you should take an early
          opportunity, to intimate in a proper manner and in the proper quarter, that the Diplomatic
          Representative whom the Pope may commission to the United States, should be a <hi rend="italics">layman</hi> and not a <hi rend="italics">Priest</hi>. You will readily
          <pb/>understand the reasons for this suggestion.</p>

        <salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>Your despatch giving official information of the sudden overthrown of the French
          Monarchy, and the establishment of a Provisional Government, based on Republican
          principles in its stead, was received at the Department of State two days ago. You will

          Steamer which will convey to you this letter, that it has given me pleasure to approve
          your prompt recognition of the new Government. On tomorrow I will send a message to
          Congress, communicating a copy of your despatch, and expressing my unqualified approval of
          your conduct. Your position, upon the sudden emergency which occurred, was delicate and
          highly responsible. You met the occasion as became the Representative of the greatest
          Republic on earth. It affords me great pleasure, to express to you these sentiments. The
          news of the revolution in France, and the establishment of free Government, has been
          received with general joy, throughout our countrey. The National Intelligencer &amp; a few
          Federal leaders, true to their instinctive hatred of liberal principles, constitute the
          exceptions to the general rule.</p>
        <p>You will learn that I have appointed <name type="person">

              Martin</hi>
                    </name>, your Secretary of Legation, to be charge' d' affaires to the Papal
          States. It is desireable that he should proceed to Rome, and enter on the duties of his
          mission, with as little delay as may be consistent, with his convenience, and the
          necessary arrangements, which he have to make. His appointment, leaves a vacancy in the
          office of Secretary of Legation, and I request that you will inform me, whom you may
          desire to have appointed. It is usual to consult the minister in regard to his Secretary
          of legation, and to accord to his wishes in the selection.</p>

        <salute>Sir,</salute>
        <p>I am aware that much of your time is occupied, and shall be brief in my remarks, hoping
          the importance of the case, will excuse this liberty. A copy of the memorial passed by the
          Legislature, at its last session, together with papers containing the account of the
          massacre of <name type="person">Dr. Whitman</name>, and others, at <name type="place">Waülatper</name> by the Cayuse Indians, were forwarded to Congress by <name type="person">Mr. J. Meek</name>. I also forwarded duplicates via California, as <name type="person">Mr. Meek</name> left Walla Walla on the 4th ult. he will no doubt reach
          you in May. I send with this a file of the Spectator, and an Extra issued to-day, together
          with a Copy of my last Proclamation<note place="foot" n="1">Enclosures, including the
            Oregon City <hi rend="italics">Oregon Spectator</hi>, not found. In his proclamation of
              <date when="1848-04-01">April 1, 1848</date>, Abernethy called for three hundred
            troops to join <name type="person">Col. Henry A. G. Lee</name>'s Oregon regiment for six
            months. He stressed the need, through the threat of force, to maintain the goodwill of
            peaceful Indians and to keep unfriendly Indians out of the Willamette Valley. See the
            proclamation in <abbr>
                            <hi rend="italics">EIWO</hi>
                        </abbr>, pp. 196-97.</note> by which
          you will perceive that we are carrying on a War with the Indians of the interior.</p>
        <p>Sometime since Commissioners were sent up to treat with the different tribes, and
          endeavour to detach them from the Cayuse; they effected a great deal; the Walla Walla's,
          Nez Perce's, and other tribes, <pb/>accepted presents and declared they would remain
          friendly with the whites. Still there are a great many that will unite with the murderers,
          all the restless and turbulent spirits among the different tribes, those that were guilty
          of robbing the immigrants last fall, many who look with a jealous eye on the inroads of
          the white man, So that it is to be feared a large party will take the field against us.
          Our settlers are scattered through the different vallies, many of them isolated and lying
          in such a position, that they could be swept off in a night, and the Indians be in the
          mountains out of reach next morning. Our policy is the keep the Indians busy in protecting
          their families and stock in their own Country, and by this means keep them out of the
          valley and we hope we shall succeed, but we have no money, no munitions of War, our
          patriotic Volunteers are destitute of clothing, tents and provisions even while in the
          field, still they are in good spirits and determined to fight to the last. Our powder we
          gather up by half pounds, pounds and parcels as the settlers have brought more or less in
          for their own use. This will soon be gone. I have written to <name type="person">Genl.
            Mason</name> of California for a supply of powder and lead, which I hope will come by
          the first opportunity. I have also written to Commodore Shubrick to send us a sloop of war
          to be in our river, to shew the Indians that we have force that can be brought into this
          Country if necessary.</p>
        <p>Fear and fear only rules and controls Indians-knowing this, they have been informed that
          we expected a Man of War here this summer, <pb/>and that as soon as our Great Chief heard,
          that his people had been murdered, he would send his War Chief here, to punish the
          murderers—should this pass off, and we receive no visit, from our Men of War, and no
          troops be sent into this Territory, our situation will not be an enviable one. The Indians
          will say, all this has been said to frighten us, see, their War Ships have not come, their
          soldiers have not come, they have none, do not let us be afraid any longer. Probably a
          large Immigration will be on their way to this Territory this summer. I hope that troops
          will accompany them, for the Indians are well aware of their route and the time of their
          coming and if not protected they will very likely go on to meet them and rob, plunder, and
          murder all parties not strong enough to resist them. They robbed them last year, and they
          will I fear proceed farther this year. I hope sincerely that whether Congress passes a
          Bill extending the jurisdiction of the United States over us or not, that at least One
          Regt. of Dragoons will be sent into Oregon to protect us from the Indians, and protect
          immigrants on their way hither. <name type="person">Col. Gillian</name> as you will
          perceive by the extra accompanying this, was accidentally shot on his way from <name type="place">Waülatper</name> to the <name type="place">Dalles</name>; the Col. was a
          brave man and his loss is much regretted. He was appointed by your Excellency to the
          office of “Agent of the Post office Department.” Nothing was ever effected in that
          department. An advertisement was put in the paper offering to let Contracts, but as the
          Contractor was only to get his pay out of the proceeds of the office, and even that could
          not be guaranteed to him for <pb/>four years, no one would enter into a Contract to carry
          the Mail. Consequently no mail has been started in the Territory under the Authority of
          the United States.</p>
        <p>Feeling confident that you will aid us in our difficulties, I have placed before you
          briefly our situation, merely stating in conclusion, we have told the Indians in order to
          prevent their uniting against us, that troops and vessels of War would soon be here.</p>

                    </name>, the
          Representative in Congress from Arkansas, has submitted to me a letter addressed by you to
          him, on the <pb/>20th of February last, in which you inform him that <name type="person">
                        <hi rend="italics">Dewitt Clinton Yell</hi>

                    </name>, had decided to decline accepting
          the appointment of Cadet at West Point. So great was my regard for the father, and so
          great is my anxiety for the w[e]lfare<note place="foot" n="1">Letter here and below
            missing, light ink transfer.</note> of the son, that I feel it to be my d[u]ty, to say
          to you, that I think the latter will make a great mistake if he declines to a[c]cept, the
          appointment to West Point. [Unyielding]<note place="foot" n="2">Word uncertain, light ink
            transfer. Polk inserted this word with a caret, hence the capitalized “In.”</note> In
          this convictio[n] and believing that upon proper explanations being made to him, he might
          reconsider his decision, I have directed his appointment, and transmit to you herewith his
          warrant, signed by the Secretary of War,<note place="foot" n="3">Enclosure, signed by
            William L. Marcy, not found.</note> with a request that you will cause it to be
          forwarded to him. I know as you state in your letter, that <name type="person">
                        <hi rend="italics">Col. Yell</hi>
                    </name> was in his lifetime opposed to the Institution at
          West Point, but that is no sufficient reason why his son should decline to receive the
          benefits of an education conferred at it. If he declines the Institution will still exist,
          and some other young man will be appointed in his place. I think he should accept, because
          being limited in his circumstance, he will be enabled <hi rend="italics">without
            expense</hi>, to acquire as good an education, as can be conferred at any college or
          University in the Union. When he graduates, if he wishes to continue in the Military
          service, he will have a respectable profession for life, or if he prefers to resign and
          engage in other pursuits, he will be permitted to do so. His father fell in battle in the
          heroic discharge of his duty, and it is approtiate, that the son should be educated at the
          public expense. I am sure if his father was alive he would advise him to accept, <pb/>and
          you know that I would not do so, if I did not believe, that it was for his best interest.
          The truth is, I take an unusual interest in <name type="person">
                        <hi rend="italics">Clinton</hi>
                    </name>’s welfare, and desire to see him a well-educated, respectable and
          useful citizen, and it is because I do so, that I now address you on the subject. I
          request that you will forward to him, the enclosed <hi rend="italics">cadet warrant</hi>,
          and make known to him my views. Whether he declines or accepts he should without delay,
          make known his final decision to the Secetary of War. I shall be pleased to hear from you
          on the subject.</p>

        <salute>Sir,</salute>
        <p>I feel assured, that you will favorably regard the liberty I take, in making this
          application, (<hi rend="italics">not for office</hi>) to you, without the ceremony of a
          personal introduction. I am deputed by an Institution chartered by the Legislature of this

          <pb/>to erect suitable buildings and to procure philosophical apparatus. In order to

          therefore, with this view, I respectfully solicit from you letters to these gentlemen,

        <salute>Sir,</salute>
        <p>In conformity with the understanding of this day I have the honor submit the following
          statement and opinion in relation to the claim of Brig. Genl. <name type="person">Twiggs</name> for a brevet on account of services in the battle of “Monterey.”</p>
        <p>On the <date when="--09-21">21st of Sept.</date> being the first day of active operations
          against the Town of Monterey, I was with the party who carried the first fort taken, and
          on passing through the fort in pursuit of the retreating enemy, I saw Genl. <name type="person">D. E. Twiggs</name> in a position of great personal exposure and heard him
          cheering our men to active pursuit. My orders and duties soon sumoned me to another part
          of the field and I did not again see Genl. <name type="person">Twiggs</name> during the
          day. For the estimate placed upon his services by the Comdg. Genl. I refer to the
          commendation bestowed on Genl. <name type="person">Twiggs</name> in the official report of
          the investment and reduction of Monterey.</p>
        <p>On the morning of the <date when="1846-09-21">21st Sept 1846</date>, when the Troops were
          marched against the east end of <name type="place">Monterey</name>, the purpose was not
          <pb/>understood to be an attack, but only to make such demonstration as would enable Genl.
            <name type="person">Worth</name>’s command to pass round to the position selected for it
          at the West end of the Town. Upon such assurance Genl. <name type="person">Twiggs</name>
          who was quite ill turned over his command to the second officer (Col. <name type="person">Garland</name>) and as I was informed at the time retired by advice of Genl. <name type="person">Taylor</name> to his tent, but fearing that an attack might be made or
          combat otherwise occur he returned to the field and went direct to the point on which his
          division had marched. He found the volunteers storming the Fort, and I found him close
          behind the retreating enemy. It has been stated that Genl. <name type="person">Twiggs</name> was not with his division and therefore not entitled to a brevet, to
          which I answer, he went to the place against which his division had been marched but
          before he arrived that division had been withdrawn from the attack and was in fractions,
          in and on houses, behind fences, and in the corn; the Volunteers who had been brought
          forward to sustain the attack on the first fort, renewed the assault and carried it by
          storm. Immediately after passing through the fort thus taken I saw Genl. <name type="person">Twiggs</name> and he was the only Genl. officer I did see with the advance
          of the assailants.</p>
        <p>In conclusion I will say that according to the principle upon which other brevets were
          granted I consider it just and due to Genl. <name type="person">Twiggs</name> that he
          should be breveted, for services at Monterey on the first day of the attack, and that
          Genl. <name type="person">Taylor</name>’s report is sufficient warrant for such
          brevet.</p>

          success of their recent efforts to consolidate the principles of liberty in a Republican

            sending <name type="person">Rush</name>’s dispatch to <name type="person">James
              Buchanan</name> of <date when="1848-03-04">March 4, 1848</date>, and its enclosures

              J. Donelson</name>, <date when="1848-02-02">April 2, 1848</date>) to Congress, Polk
            approves Rush’s recognition of the new French government, expresses the United States’
            “congratulations” toward the French people, affirms <name type="place">America</name>’s
            “policy . . . of non-intervention in the domestic affairs of other countries” but its
            support for “free government” everywhere, and asserts, “The world has seldom witnessed a
            more interesting or sublime spectacle than the peaceful rising of the French people,
            resolved to secure for themselves enlarged liberty, and to assert . . . the great truth,
            that in this enlightened age man is capable of governing himself.” Senate Executive
            Document No. 32, 30th Congress, 1st Session, pp. 1–2.</note>
                </p>
        <p>These expressions of congratulation and of sympathy, on the part of the Legislative and
          Executive Departments of the Government, but reflect the general sentiment and feeling of
          their constituents. The people of the United States can never receive with indifference,
          the progress of civil liberty in any portion of the world; but they witness its advances
          with peculiar interest, in the Nation which must ever be associated in their memories with
          the struggles and the triumphs of their own Revolution. The great principles of popular
          sovereignty which were proclaimed in <date when="1776">1776</date>, by the immortal author
          of our Declaration of Independence, seem now to be in the course of rapid developement
          throughout the world. It was especially fit, that they should receive their noblest
          illustration abroad, among the countrymen of La Fayette. The sudden achievement of their
          freedom, which has been recently accomplished by the French people, is no less remarkable
          for the spirit of order, by which it has been attended, than it is, for the magnitude of
          the results to which it has led. In the further pursuit of the great objects in view, it
          is hoped that the people and Government of France, may preserve the same law of social
          order, and the same regard for the public peace, which now distinguish them; that they may
          be spared the necessity of wars with neighbouring nations, so uncongenial with
          <pb/>Republican Government; that they may successfully restrain all tendencies to anarchy
          and bloodshed within their own borders, and that they may, by thus adding strength to
          their new institutions, increase their claims to the admiration of mankind.</p>
        <p>The <name type="place">United States</name> extend to <name type="place">France</name>,
          their warm congratulations and their ardent sympathy, and rejoice to anticipate for their
          ancient ally, under the benign sway of enlightened freedom, a long career of peace,
          prosperity and happiness.</p>

        <salute>My dear sir</salute>
        <p>Having an opportunity by the British Courier to send a letter safely to our despatch
          agent in London, who will forward it to the <name type="place">United States</name>, I
          avail myself of the occasion to communicate with you on a subject that may not be new, but
          concerning which, any information from a reliable source cannot but be of interest. I
          allude to the condition of <name type="place">Cuba</name>. I have lately had a
          conversation with a very intelligent officer of Engineers in the Russian service, who
          returned early in the winter from <name type="place">America</name> where he had been
          making a tour, taking <name type="place">Cuba</name>, on his return route. His position
          &amp; intelligence are such as would secure to him access to the most respectable and
          influential circles in that island, and his cool judgment and well balanced intellect are
          the surest guarantees that he does not over-state what he observed, or over-rate its
          importance. He informs me that the feeling was universal among those with whom he mixed,
          to separate from the Mother country, and put that fine island to use his own expression
          “under the protection of the <name type="place">United States</name>.” What was meant by
          “under the protection” of our country, whether after maintaining a separate independence,
          to become annexed as a state of the confederacy, or whether that our interests would lead
          us to protect <pb/>them from European interference, should they affect their independence,
          I am unable to say, though I infer the former. He further added that in the present
          agitated condition of the southern and western portion of this Continent, he should expect
          soon to hear of a demonstration in <name type="place">Cuba</name>, having reference to an
          entire separation from the old country, which holds to the colony but by very feeble
          hands. Although I have not made this subject the topic of a formal despatch, yet I have
          felt it my duty to communicate the facts confidentially to you, for so deeply have I been
          impressed by them, that I cannot but apprehend that you may have to meet questions from
          that quarter, much earlier than any one could have anticipated two months ago.</p>
        <p>You are of course more accurately, and earlier, advised of the popular movements in
          different parts of <name type="place">Europe</name> and of their tendency to free
          institutions, than you could be by any communications from so distant a point as that,
          from which I address you. Here, every thing rests, and will undoubtedly continue to rest,
          on the old foundations. Russia however will not interfere with the struggles for popular
          governments in other countries, and as each will have as much as it can attend to, in its
          own internal affairs, without attending to its neighbors, we have pretty good security
          against international wars, though some of the domestic conflicts may be sanguinary. <name type="place">Poland</name>, is the only point, where the popular movement will press
          upon <name type="place">Russia</name>; and there, it is very probable, the contest will be
          fierce. That however would be but a border conflict, and <pb/>be the result as it may,
          would not affect perceptibly the Empire of <name type="place">Russia</name> proper.</p>
        <p>Turning from what is taking place in <name type="place">Europe</name> to our own more
          favored land, I cannot but congratulate you on the peace with <name type="place">Mexico</name>. It comes at the right time, as if the hand of Providence had helped us
          to it. It is a circumstance somewhat remarkable, that the steamer which brought to <name type="place">Europe</name> the news of our peace, ratified by the Senate, should have
          passed the one on its passage from this side, conveying to you the thrilling news from
            <name type="place">Paris</name> taking its first date from the “<hi rend="italics">twenty second</hi> of february.” It is fortunate too that the exemplar republic should
          repose in honorable peace, when we have so much reason to inculcate by precept and
          example, pacific views on others, who are shaping their institutions like ours. I will
          also add, that there are no four years that will tell more prominently in the history of
          our country than those of the present administration, irrespective of the influence of our
          example.</p>
        <p>The annexation of Texas perfected—the Oregon question settled—the tariff re-constructed,
          and showing in its practical results, that lowering the taxes largely increases the
          treasury receipts—the constitutional treasury re-established, and its safety self
          vindicated by its successful working in peace and war—the war brought on by <name type="place">Mexico</name>, rolled back from our frontier to the enemys capital, and
          peace obtained on terms prescribed by ourselves—California and <name type="place">New
            Mexico</name> added to our territory—and now Bankers foreign and domestic, rivalling
          each <pb/>other in their offers of easy loans, to any amount the administration may
          desire. These are laurels that any President might be proud to wear.</p>
        <p>In my despatch to the secretary of state of the 11" of february, and in a private
          letter to yourself of the same date, I requested a recall from this Mission to take
          effect, early in the ensuing summer. Although it is not yet time to expect a reply from
          the Department, yet I hope you will pardon me from repeating here the same request and for
          the reasons there particularly explained. I am very desirous to avoid an autumnal passage
          home, my health having suffered almost irreparably long after my arrival in <name type="place">Europe</name> from the effects of my passage over at that season. There is
          no important question pending or likely to be pending, between the two governments
          rendering it necessary for me to remain here, till relieved by the arrival of a new
          Minister.</p>

                </p>
        <p>The liberty is also taken of adding a few extracts from Communications recently received
          from different Officers of the <name type="org">American Bible Society</name>,
          illustrative of its present condition and wants, as follow:</p>
        <p>“It is unpleasant for us to call upon the benevolent public for <hi rend="italics">money</hi>—much less pleasant than to speak of the extensive <hi rend="italics">distribution</hi> of the Word of God. But the truth is, we cannot speak long on the
          latter topic unless due regard is in some way paid to the former. I say <hi rend="italics">long</hi>, for we are now and have been for some weeks making extensive distributions,
          far exceeding in value our income, but must soon curtail, unless funds are more amply
          furnished. It must be borne in mind that we have now some <hi rend="italics">three
            hundred</hi> hands employed daily in the manufacture of Bibles and Testaments, and print
          up seven or eight tons of paper per week. Here is a heavy expenditure which must be
          promptly met. It is too a <hi rend="italics">needful</hi> expenditure and cannot be
          diminished without hazard to the best interests of our country; for while our issues
          exceed 2000 copies per day, we do not in any measure <hi rend="italics">supply</hi> our
          population, nor meet demands for the Bible as fast as they come upon us. A large
          <pb/>number of orders are now unexecuted &amp; must remain so for some days.</p>
        <p>“We have then in addition to these home wants, numerous calls from abroad—some of them
          urgent.</p>
        <p>“Those who can become <hi rend="italics">Life Directors</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Life
            Members</hi>, and let the funds there furnished go to the foreign field, will render a
          service which cannot be over estimated.”</p>
        <p>On this last point the following resolution was some time since adopted by the Board of
          Managers of the Bible Society of this city:</p>
        <p>Resolved, That we respectfully invite our fellow citizens, who have the means, to
          constitute themselves and their friends Life Members of the <name type="org">American
            Bible Society</name> by the payment of $30 at one time, or Life Directors by the payment
          of $150., which <hi rend="italics">may</hi> be made in three equal annual payments; or
          Life Members of the city Society by the payment of $15 at one time or $20 at two
          payments.</p>
        <p>The number of books issued from the Depository of the <name type="org">Am. Bible
            Society</name> during the first eight months of the current year of the Society is
          180.922 Bibles &amp; 338.708 Testaments or 519.630 volumes, and yet the demands are not
          met, and the appeal of the Corresponding Secretary for funds to prepare copies is “<hi rend="italics">Try to aid us all you can</hi>.”</p>
        <p>Other extracts from letters recently received from the Secretaries of the Parent Society
          might be added, but they are deemed, in this connection, wholly unnecessary.</p>
        <p>The Agent of the Society, or the Secretary, will take the liberty of <pb/>calling at the
          Presidential Mansion next Monday; when he will be happy to receive, for the Society, such
          donations as the President and his family may be pleased to make, and to give such
          direction respecting the amount received as may be most agreeable to the donors, unless
          the President should prefer to transmit, in the interim, a donation to the Society.</p>

        <salute>Sir</salute>
        <p>I have recently learnt by a letter from Washington, that you design to make a selection
          from New England to fill the vacant office of Attorney General, and that the two most
          prominent candidates presented for your <pb/>consideration, are Governor Toucey of this
          State and <name type="person">Mr Rantoul</name> of <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>.</p>
        <p>Without disparaging <name type="person">Mr Rantoul</name>, I think I can with safety say
          that few gentlemen of ours in <name type="place">New England</name>, rank higher, than
          does <name type="person">Mr Toucey</name> as a lawyer. Your personal acquaintance with
          him, renders it unnecessary that I should say anything of him as a man and a gentleman. As
          a politician hee has ever been firm and consistent, and upon a question which is, or may
          now become, one of vital importance as touching our Union, <name type="person">Mr
            Toucey</name> has always been frank and decided, as well as correct, while <name type="person">Mr Rantoul</name>, has at times taken a course, in reference to it,
          calculated to compromise the best interests of our country. I refer to political
          abolitionism. When <name type="person">Mr Toucey</name> was last a candidate for congress,
          he was interogated, upon this subject; and I take the liberty of enclosing to you a paper
          containing his answer.<note place="foot" n="2">In the enclosed newspaper clipping of <name type="person">Isaac Toucey</name> to <name type="person">Amos M</name>. <name type="person">Collins</name> and <name type="person">Waterman Roberts</name>, <date when="1839-03-16">March 16, 1839</date>, <name type="person">Toucey</name> responds to
            two questions from the Connecticut Anti-Slavery Society. Asked whether he supports “‘the
            immediate abolition of slavery in the <name type="org">District of Columbia</name>,’” he
            answers that such an act of Congress “would be unconstitutional and void, because it
            bears no analogy to the taking of private property for public use.” Asked whether he is
            “opposed to the admission to the Union of any new State whose constitution tolerates
            slavery,” he answers that Congress must never refuse to admit a state, for doing so
            would render it either “a foreign State” or “a vassal province, [governed] by despotic
            power sustained by physical force.” Each new state, he asserts, has the right to decide
            for itself about slavery. Toucey adds that Northerners have no “right to interfere with”
            slavery in the South and that abolitionist control of Northern state governments would
            spell the end of the United States: “<name type="org">America</name> would be drenched
            in the blood of our countrymen slain by each other’s hands, and the last hope of <name type="org">African</name> emancipation . . . would be extinguished forever.”

                </p>
        <p>He has ever since maintained the same ground and has of late done much to establish a
          correct public opinion upon the question in <name type="org">Connecticut</name>.</p>

        <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
        <p>I have written to you but seldom because I expect you have business up to the Chin, to
          attend to for the nation of far greater importance, than I have to write, about. But
          unless you can get them <name type="org">Newyork</name> folks united, the chances are two
          to one against us, in the next election for President, &amp; they consist of such d—d
          compounds that I have but very little hope of it. As Clay is to be the candidate, of the
          whigs I think we can beat him in <name type="org">Tennessee</name>, the next canvass, but
          what will that avail us Since some of our best headed Southern states has pledged the
          <pb/>democracy to vote for no man who will not come out Broadly vs the Willmot proviso.
          This was throwing stumbling Blocks in the way of the Northern democracy Which they dare
          not approach in an election for President. Now my Dear Sir Unless this is a diplomatic
          movement in the South with a view to fall down to the <name type="place">Missouri</name>
          Compromise line as an Ultimatum, I think it was impolitick in our friends to start it. If
          the <name type="person">Willmot P</name> comes up legitimately either in the establishment
          of a territorial Government or in the admission of a state we must meet it as well as we
          can, but to start it in the canvass for President, we may loose but cannot gain. Our
          prospects does not appear to me to be flattering.</p>
        <p>In relation to yourself you have fought the good fight, and kept the faith amidst such
          storms and persecutions as I thought was wholly improbable would be heaped upon a man, who
          was not a candidate for reelection. But the whigs Satan like had rather “reign in Hell
          than serve in heaven” and there is no respite from their malice But the completing the
          Texas question, the Settlement of the Oregon Controversy, the brilliant campaigns in <name type="org">mexico</name>, the establishment of all the democratic measures, has placed
          you upon such ground as to be wholly at Whig defiance, now and forever.</p>
        <p>We will give a good account of the whigs in Ten, and vote for any good democrat, tho I am
          in favour of <name type="person">Buchanan</name> first, yet cass, <name type="org">Dallas</name>, <name type="org">Woodbury Dix</name>, and others will do.</p>
        <p>I have married a woman of suitable age, respectable property, no <pb/>children of her
          own, and do not practice law out of <name type="org">Madison</name> County. I have not
          applied either to the State or general government for any sort of an appointment
          heretofore and confidently ask now for one at your hands (towit), That you will send me a
          commission under the great seal of the <name type="org">United States</name>, to stay at
          home and sleep with my wife and tell <name type="org">Mrs. Polk</name> to countersign it
          as your private Secretary, and if you dont send it, I will sleep with her without it.</p>
        <p>Present me kindly to <name type="person">Mrs Polk</name> and accept for yourself my
          esteem &amp;c.</p>

        <p>An unavoidable interruption of business, prevents me from saying anything more to day,
          than thanking you which I do from the bottom of my heart, for the signal honor &amp;
          kindness which you have confer[r]ed<note place="foot" n="1">Letter obscured by wax
            seal.</note> upon me by appointing me to the important post of Chargé d’ Affaires at
            <name type="place">Rome</name>. It was a favor as great as it was unexpected, and will
          be an incentive to me to prove myself worthy of your confidence &amp; kindness. If I
          attempted to express all the gratitude I feel, my language would perhaps appear too warm,
          for this act has plucked me from the slough of despond in which I was fast sinking, with
          disappointed hopes &amp; broken health. I am sorry for the accident which prevents me from
          referring to the topics in your kind letter<note place="foot" n="2">

          would fail, and I must reserve what I have to say, for the opportunity next week, even the
          official acknowledgement of my commission &amp;c. I will only add now, that your prompt
          &amp; cordial approbation of the course of <name type="person">Mr. Rush</name>, was in the
          highest degree gratifying to us all, &amp; produced the happiest effect in our new sister

          off, very quietly &amp; will probably result in the choice of an overwhelming majority,

        <salute>Dear uncle,</salute>
        <p>I reached Salisbury this morning about 4 o’clock and found no stage departing for
          Morganton and I have to stay here until Tuesday morning. I hear mother is worse and I am
          very anxious to get home. It has taken me twenty eight dollars to come this far and it
          will take the remainder of the $75 which I had in my pocket when I started to pay my bill
          when I leave here. I am unwell myself and I am afraid I will take sick before I reach
          home. If nothing happens I will <hi rend="italics">be</hi> home Wednesday &amp; I will
          write you from there. Give my love to aunt <name type="person">Sarah</name>. Excuse my
          writing for I have a bad pen &amp; my head aches miserably.</p>
        <p>Your affectionate nephew</p>

        <salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>I have received your kind letter of the 14th ultimo, informing me that another piece of
          my land had been sold for the taxes in <date when="1844">1844</date>.<note place="foot" n="1">Letter not found.</note> You state that <hi rend="italics">Mr Rayburn</hi> who
          claims it under the tax sale demands $50. for a relinquishment of his title. It is better
          to pay the $50. than to engage in litigation or to have further trouble about it. I
          request that you will do me the favour to pay it, &amp; draw on me for the same. When you
          do so you will of course take a relinquishment of title from <hi rend="italics">Mr
            Rayburn</hi>. I am under the belief that the taxes on this as well as the other lands
          which were returned last year were paid, and it is probable that the receipts may be among
          my private papers, in <name type="place">Tennessee</name>, but of this I am not certain.
          When you make the payment to <hi rend="italics">Mr Rayburn</hi>, perhaps he will agree to
          refund, provided, the receipts are hereafter produced. But whether he agrees [to]<note place="foot" n="2">Word or letters here and below missing, light ink transfer.</note>
          this or not, it is best to pay, him the $50. which he claims, though I think he does not
          deal with me, as I would with him under similar circumstances. He must know that I
          intended to have the tax paid, and that if it was not done by my overseer, it was the
          result, of accid[ent] or ignorance on his part. It is annoying to me to be thus troubled,
          and to be compelled to put you to trouble on so small a matter. To prevent like errors
          hereafter, I must ask the favour of you to examine the receipts for taxes, for subsequent
          years which <hi rend="italics">Mr Marrs</hi>, may have <pb/>[in] his possession; and if
            <hi rend="italics">Col. Campbell</hi> has taken them home with him, that you see the
            <name type="person">Sheriff</name> or collector, and ascertain upon an examination of
          his Books, that all my taxes have been paid. I will write to <hi rend="italics">Col.
            Campbell</hi> &amp; request him to enclose to you, all my tax [receipts]<note place="foot" n="3">Word uncertain, light ink transfer.</note> which he may have in his
          possession. <hi rend="italics">Mr Marrs</hi> writes to me that he has purchased a mule at
          $80. and may have to purchase another.<note place="foot" n="4">

              1848</date>.</note> Unless he has collected <hi rend="italics">Harry’s hire</hi>, he
          has no money to pay for these. When you draw on me for the $50. to be paid to <hi rend="italics">Mr Rayburn</hi>, &amp;<note place="foot" n="5">
                        <name type="person">Polk</name> probably meant to write “I.”</note> will thank you to draw also for the
          price of the mules, and hand it over to <hi rend="italics">Mr Marrs</hi>. Your draft will
          be paid at sight. I hope I may have it in my power, some day, to reciprocate the kindness
          you have done me in attending to my business. I have not yet sold my cotton crop of last
          year, and will not do so, at present prices.</p>

        <salute>Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>I have received your letter of the 8th of the last month, and am glad to learn that you
          were nearly done planting. <hi rend="italics">Mr Leigh</hi> writes to me, that some more
          of my land has been sold for the taxes.<note place="foot" n="1">Reference is to <name type="person">John T.

          to me that the boy <hi rend="italics">Joe</hi> who was taken down by <hi rend="italics">Col. Campbell</hi>, left you in February. I hope you have got him back before this
          time. I have not yet sold my cotton crop of last year, and will not do so at present
          prices. As soon as it is sold, I will pay the hands for the bags which were set apart for
          them, and you may so inform them. You inform me that you have purchased a mule at $80. and
          that you may need another. If so you must purchase one. I have written to <hi rend="italics">Mr Leigh</hi> to draw on me for the price of them, and to hand the money
          over to you to pay for them, if he can do so. The Bill which he drew in your favour will
          be paid, at any moment when it is presented.</p>
        <p>I wish you to be particular in paying my taxes, and in order to be sure that the land is
          properly described in the Receipts, from the <name type="person">Sheriff</name>, shew them
          to <hi rend="italics">Mr Leigh</hi>, as I do not wish to have any further trouble about
          the taxes.</p>
        <p>You must continue to write to me at the beginning of every month how you are getting on
          with my business.</p>

        <p>I suspect “Rivers &amp; Harbors” are soon to be discussed in Congress if not at <name type="place">Baltimore</name>. If so, it is important that your veto message &amp; the
          documents should be printed &amp; laid upon the tables of members. Though almost five
          months have elapsed, I have not seen this document, &amp; from what I learn it has not
          been printed. If this is so, I think it due to you &amp; the country that it be printed
          &amp; distributed instanter. Goodmen in Congress &amp; in the Press do not understand this
          matter &amp; will not until they “see the documents.”</p>

        <salute>Sir</salute>
        <p>I beg leave to invite your attention to the subject of clothing for Volunteers. The
          recent order of the Adjt. <name type="person">Genl. Jones</name> on the subject, has
          produced a deep murmur throughout the Volunteer corps. I see nothing in the law of
          Congress to authorise the construction given to that law (the one authorising clothing in
          kind to be issued to the Volunteers) by the secretary of war. The Volunteers came into the
          service, expecting $3.50 per month for commutation of clothing and great dissatisfaction
          will prevail, if it is not allowed them, of course deducting from that sum, all issues in
          kind. <name type="person">Gen. Towson</name> is of opinion that they are entitled to
          <pb/>$3.50 per month, deducting issues of clothing in kind. I shall not argue this
          question to you, but merely call your attention to it, that if you agree with me, that
          $3.50 per month should be paid the soldier for clothing, that you can give the necessary
          order, in time to meet the discharged soldier, at <name type="place">New Orleans</name>,
          where, the war being ended, I understand they will be discharged. Most of the vol’trs are
          of the right faith &amp; I would greatly dislike to see them go home soured with the
          Democratic Administration for the small sum of one dollar per month, by an order which I
          most sincerely believe not to be warranted by law.</p>

        <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
        <p>Providence has deprived us during the last few hours, of one of the Academic Staff. The
          Professor of French is dead. He has been cut down <pb/>with his harness on, and at the
          post of duty. <name type="person">Mr Berard</name> was suddenly prostrated in his section
          room yesterday about noon, and continued speechless till this morning when his spirit left
          us, we trust for a better world.</p>
        <p>He has been a faithful servant of the Military Academy for more than thirty years, and
          has left behind him the best impressions of his worth as a man, a father, husband friend,
          and of his fidelity, in the discharge of his duty. He has left a large family, who are now
          destitute, and who are illy prepared to sustain themselves by their own exertions.</p>
        <p>Professor <name type="person">Berard</name> held the office of Post-Master at the Point,
          the proceeds of which with his pay for teaching enabled him to maintain his family. Now
          what we earnestly desire is, that the office may be given to his wife <name type="person">Mrs. Berard</name>, who is amply qualified for its duties, and who could employ his
          oldest daughter as clerk. This would enable her to keep her children together, and meet
          the hearty approbation of all, I am satisfied, connected with the Institution. If
          necessary we could forward a petition signed by the Military and Academic Staff. Of one
          thing your Excellency may be assured that the duties will be faithfully performed and an
          important service rendered a deserving widow and her family. I do hope, Sir, that this
          request will meet with your kind consideration. It will be a popular and gratefully recd.
          act by all in our own community.</p>

        <salute>Sir</salute>
        <p>I have just received from <name type="place">New Jersey</name>, three letters containing
          the sad intelligence of the Total defeat of the Democratic party in <name type="place">old
            Nottingham</name> (the name it has been termed) “the <hi rend="italics">salt</hi> of
          Mercer,” in the words of one person, who has written to me, “we are routed, Horse, foot,
          &amp; dragoons.” Every one, in the Borough of South Trenton have been defeated by a large
          majority, and one of the most bitter Whigs has been elected in my Brothers place. A son,
          of the late defaulting Treasurer of <name type="place">New Jersey</name> (<name type="person">Isaac Southard</name> Brother of <name type="person">Saml. L.
            Southard</name>, formerly a Senator) <name type="person">James W. Southard</name>, has
          been elected one of Whig-Burgesses of that Borough.</p>
        <p>The night before the Election, my Brother wrote to me. “I shall be re-elected to the
          Responsible Office, which I now hold there is no doubt, as I have seen <name type="person">Mr. John Phares</name>, and he says, there will be no opposition Ticket, he is a Whig
          and you know a great Politician, and our party have nominated me, for Chief Burgess,
          unanimously.” Here I think, can be seen the course of their defeat, they were lulled into
          security, and in that way was captured by their Enemies, but Sir, I think it is “all for
          the best.” <pb/>I have written several letters to our friends, earnestly entreating them,
          to array themselves and prepare for the Presidental campaign with renewed vigour and
          energy, &amp; not to mind this <hi rend="italics">paltry</hi> defeat, but prepare for the
          great contest. They say, “we are humbled to the very dust” and bitterly do they lament
          their Apathy. Never were men more discouraged, and are really dispairing at the result, as
          the other party are so much elevated by this “first Gun from <name type="place">New
            Jersey</name>, the very strong hold of Democracy has surrendered to them.” It is hailed
          as the grand Signal of Defeat to the Democratic party, but what if they gain the whole
          state, it will be no loss to us, for it has been theirs for years.</p>
        <p>I know, <hi rend="italics">stump</hi> Orators, will sound the alarm, that the Democracy
          of <name type="place">N. Jersey</name> in one of their strongest holds, have been
          vanquished in Consequence of the present administration, the war &amp;c.</p>
        <p>I know it will be used for <hi rend="italics">effect</hi>, by them, but although humbled,
          they should not be so disheartened, their cause is good, for when the present Chief
          Burgess came into power, the <name type="person">Borough</name> was in Debt, which has
          been paid off, by his means and influence. <name type="place">Old Nottingham</name> has
          been defeated, by a great loss, totally so, but it is “All for the <hi rend="italics">best</hi>,[”]<note place="foot" n="1">Closing quotation mark missing.</note> they have
          now been taught a wise lesson, I trust for the future.</p>

        <salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
        <p>Your favor of the <date when="--04-02">2d April</date> reached me in due time, and I was
          not disappointed that you did not grant me leave of absence. Indeed if you had granted it
          I should not have availed myself of it, for ever since that period every moment has been
          one of the deepest responsibility to the Minister here. This will appear from my
          despatches, in which I have endeavored to keep the Department advised of the progress of
          the various movements that are threatening the general peace of <name type="place">Europe</name>.</p>
        <p>To day the votes are being counted which will decide who are to be the Delegates to <name type="place">Frankfort</name> and to the constituant assembly here. I have been in daily
          intercourse with some of the leading candidates. One of them in anticipation of his
          Election has just addressed me a note asking me for a sketch of our Constitution and my
          opinion of its applicability to the <name type="place">German</name> States. I will give
          it in <hi rend="italics">writing</hi> but in such a manner as to avoid making myself a
          partizan of a political question foreign to us, yet at the same time encouraging the
          effort to found the proposed Government on our Republican basis. After being furnished
          with <name type="place">Mr. Buchanans</name> despatch to <name type="person">Mr.
            Rush</name> I can scarcely go wrong.</p>
        <p>There is every probability that the proceedings at <name type="place">Frankfort</name>
          will result in the adoption of a constitution which will transfer to the new
          <pb/>Government all the Diplomatic functions of the several states. To be prepared for
          this event I wish to be furnished with powers to this new Government. As matters are now
          working the United states will be the nation upon which <name type="place">Germany</name>
          will chiefly rely in making its first national demonstration. Its whole policy will be
          changed in commercial matters. To build up a Navy, to acquire a custom house jurisdiction
          like ours, and to counteract the restrictive and selfish legislation of other countries,
          will be its leading aim at first. Whilst getting rid of dependence on <name type="place">England</name>, and creating a commercial marine, she will encourage our shipping
          rather than that of any <name type="place">European</name> competitor.</p>
        <p>It seems that this King does not yet shrink from the support of the New Government.
          Possibly he looks to his election as the Emperor. But my idea is that neither he nor his
          friends see the real drift of that work. Whatever may be its features in regard to the
          Dynastic character of the Executive, whilst it presumes to the people Universal suffrage,
          it will gradually undermine and destroy the Monarchic principle. It will centralise <name type="place">Germany</name> in the first place, until it gets rid of the old remnants of
          feudalism, when all will be subjected to the checks and ballances of our system. Louis
          Phillip fell because he owed his crown to the election of the people. So will it be with
          the next Emperor here if one is taken. Germany tends as inevitably to a republic, as
          Universal suffrage does to extirpate whatever opposes political equality.</p>
        <p>Before this reaches you the Democratic convention will have acted. <pb/>Cut off from all
          correspondence with my friends, who seem to have forgotten me, I have no means of judging
          of the public temper in the <name type="place">U States</name>. I have however a sort of
          instinct in such matters which has seldom deceived me. This tells me that you must be much
          stronger than any other member of the Democratic party, yet I know not how to wish that
          you may be burdened with the cares of the Presidency another 4 years. How often have I
          wondered when rising from <name type="person">Genl Jacksons</name> table full of
          applications for office, and of notes for letters or messages, that great men will
          struggle, so hard for the privilege of being President. Yet it seemed a part of his life
          to wear the harness of the public servant. You have more health than he had and can
          therefore carry the burdens with more ease: but doubtless if left to yourself you will
          seek to avoid another term of the office.</p>
        <p>You have had a most eventful administration—the admission of Texas, the settlement of the
          Oregon, the present Tariff, and the conquest of <name type="place">Mexico</name>, will
          fill many pages in our history. Whatever may be the issue of the next Presidency these
          pages will forever justify the choice of your friends in running you in <date when="1844">1844</date>. Whether the next four years are to give you or to some one else, the helm
          of state, the ship must advance in the direction you have given it, and it will be
          fortunate if it escapes the dangers through which you have steered it so successfully.</p>
        <p>With our kind regards to <name type="person">Mrs. Polk</name> &amp; to <name type="person">Mr. &amp; Mrs. Walker</name> believe me . . . .</p>

        <salute>dear Sir,</salute>
        <p>Permit me, to intrude upon your patients and time, by asking you to read a letter from a
          humble friend, given what he believes to be a true state of the factions of the democratic
          party, as it now stands in the state of <name type="org">New York</name>. I, have been in
          the city ever since the <date when="1848-04-15">15th of April</date>, during which time, I
          have had opportunities of mixen and conversing with the leading men of both factions of
          the party, in this state, with a view to learn, if possiable, what would unite the party
          in the great, state of <name type="place">New York</name>, and thus secure certain victory
          in <date when="1848">1848</date> to the democratic party, as if we loose <name type="place">New York</name> our success next fall to say the least of it will be
          doubtfull. There is a very hostile and determined feeling existing between the factions of
          the party here. Each faction claimes to be the regular po[r]tion<note place="foot" n="1">Letter or digit here and below inserted to complete probable meanings.</note> of the
          party, or the party itself. The leading men of what is <pb/>called, the Barnburners, say,
          that the <hi rend="italics">old Hunkers,</hi> cannot muster over 2000. votes in the great
          city of <name type="place">New York</name>, and cannot carry over from, two to four
          counties in the whole state, and that the old Hunker faction in the city all went for the
          whig, candidate for mayor in the late election, &amp;c. while on the other hand, the old
          Hunker po[r]tion of the party say they have a large majority of the party in the state,
          and that there delegates must, be admitted into the <name type="place">Baltimore</name>
          Convention &amp; the others excluded, while the Barnburners say if they are, excluded the
          democracy of <name type="place">New York</name> State will form a seperate, ticket and run
          there own man, &amp;c. Now this is about the position the two factions stand here, and it
          is hard for any person to tell what is best to do under the circumstances to get them to
          gether again, or which is the, strongest po[r]tion of the party. But one thing is as
          certain as the noon day, if General, Cass, is nominated by the <name type="place">Baltimore</name> Convention, he will losse this state by 35,00[0]–40,000 and what
          effect this would have upon the final, result of the election next fall, would not be hard
          to predict. The Barnburners, say that they will never unite upon him upon no
          consideration. These are willing to unite on <hi rend="italics">your honor</hi>, <name type="person">Mr Buchanan</name> or <name type="person">Judge Woodbury</name> (but not
          on Gen. Cass, for reasons, which I will give you if, I, live to see you next Week). You I,
          presume are aware that <name type="person">Mr Buchanan</name> is my first choice above all
          others, under the present condition of affairs. But, sir at the same time I say to you,
          that you have it in your power, to carry the state of <name type="place">New York</name>,
          at the next election stronger than any other living man, <pb/>unless you would throw your
          energies &amp; influence in favor of <name type="person">Mr Buchanan</name> or <name type="person">Mr Woodbury</name>. You would have but one thing to do &amp; that would,
          be but right and just, among friends, and that would be simply to recognize, the,
          Barnburners, as <hi rend="italics">friends</hi> and divide the patronage which their state
          is intitled to be tween the two factions (more of this in detail if I live to see you,)
          and if this is done, my life for it you can carry this state in the convention &amp; at
          the polls next fall by 20,000 or 25,000 of a majority &amp; stronger I believe than any
          other man in the nation, unless, you would use your influence in favor of <name type="person">Mr. Buchanan</name>, then I think he is the next strongest man to your
          self, and unless some such course is taken, you will see, in all probability, <name type="place">New York</name> State, lossed to the party, and that two for years to come,
          and perhaps, the party defeated in the nation which would be a national calamity at this
          time as it would be a direct slate at your administration and would be look upon, by the
          old world as a condemnation of all the great measures, which you have carried out, during
          your administration. Under all the circumstances you or one of your cabinet should be
          nominated and let the American people say whether, or not they approve of the great, and
          glorious measures, which you have carried out &amp; accomplished, during the period of
          your administration. I, do think that it is important, not only to the great democratic
          party of the nation but to our whole country &amp; to the world that we should be
          victorious at the next election and thus sanction the great, achievements which we as a
          nation have won during the past 4 <pb/>years. What a calamity it would be, yes the next
          generation would lament, if we should, by a factious division among ourselves (which can
          be healed, as well as not) loose our next President, and thus say, that the people of the
            <name type="place">United States</name>, have said by &amp; through the Ballot box that
          they disapproved, of the Mexican War, the Oragon Treaty, the anexation of Texas, your
          noble, patriotic &amp; humane message in favor of protecting the citizens of Yucatan from,
          destruction, and all other of the important, achievements, of your, administration. The
          Barnburners, as well as the other po[r]tion of the party approve of your administration,
          the only thing the Barnburners, complain of, off you, is this, that you, have not gave
          them as much of your favors, as you bestowed upon the old, Hunker faction, but even this
          they say, they do not blame you for, it is Gov. Marcy, they blame the most. They complain
          in the city, about, the appointments, of Post Master and, collector &amp;c. more of this
          if desired whin I see you it is enough to say, that you have it in your power to be the
          next Presidential candidate, unite &amp; carry New York, or make <name type="person">Mr
            Buchanan</name>, if you desire. If you will accept of a nomination, in case it is
          necessary to unite the party, let some, of your friends know it, <hi rend="italics">confidentially</hi>,<note place="foot" n="2">New sentence may begin before or after
              “<hi rend="italics">confidentially</hi>.”</note> you are my, first and only choice if
            <name type="person">Mr B</name>. can not, be nominated and, I think you should permit
          your friends, in case your name will mean victory use it. I am a personal &amp; a
          political friend of Gen Casses, and three months ago, he would have been my 2d choice, but
            condidately,<note place="foot" n="3">Brawley may have meant to write “candidly” or,
            inventing an adverb, “candidately.”</note> I do think he is not, our strong man just
          now, &amp; we should <pb/>run no risks. The old, Hunker delogates meets here in convention
          on the 17 of this month &amp; the Barnburners on the 18th, to make arrangments before they
          go to Baltimore. For give me for making so free, as I have, no other motive but, for the
          success of our party in view.</p>
        <p>I believe that, steps, should be taken to heal, the party in <name type="place">New
            York</name> &amp; now is the time to do, it as if there is a fight, at <name type="place">Baltimore</name> we cannot, save this state after that. I am aware that the
          great dificulty is how to get both sets of delogates reconsiled at <name type="place">Baltimore</name>, this question I have raised to two or three of the delogates in the
          city and to several of the leading men of the party and I find, that to exclude both sets
          will give better satisfaction than to admit one at the exclusion of the other. The
          Barnburners say if these are admitted these can carry the state &amp; let the old Hunkers,
          Go with the whigs, or where they please, if, this be true, you at once see that it would
          be bad policy to admit the old Hunker delegates, howevr as to the truth of this assertion
          I cannot vouch for. I believe to take the city of <name type="place">New York</name> that
          2/3 or 3/4 of the party goes with, the Barnburners, but, I think the safe way is to either
          exclude both sets, or take both sets into the convention and give them one vote &amp; when
          the two sets cannot, agree how to vote, then they have no vote, by this course a
          compromise could be expected upon you (if you will accept of a nomination,) and if not
          then I believe they would unite upon <name type="person">Mr Buchanan</name> or <name type="person">Woodbury</name>. This would be the course the Barnburners would take and I
          believe, it would meet with the views of the Hunkers. <pb/>This course will I believe save
          the party in state. The Barnburners cares nothing about the “Wilmot proviso” this humbug
          has completely exploded. This scrawl, is written to you in great haste and in perfect
          confidence, any thing that may appear improper be kind enough to excuse as it is written
          by a true friend. I will be compelled, to remain, here in the city until the middle of
          next week during which time, I would be much pleased to received, an acknowledgement of
          this line from you and any information that I can impart to you more on the eve of the
          nomination, I would be pleasd, to give you in <hi rend="italics">strict
          confidence</hi>.</p>

        <p>In obedience to your directions<note place="foot" n="1">Letter, if any, not found.</note>
          I have the honor to transmit copies <pb/>of communications from Commodore Perry, Commander
            <name type="place">Bigelow</name> and Lieut Commanding <name type="place">Mason</name>;
          with the papers which accompanied them, on the subject of the present condition of
            Yucatán.<note place="foot" n="2">Mason enclosed copies of or extracts from dispatches he
            had received from <name type="person">Matthew C. Perry</name>, <name type="person">Abraham Bigelow</name>, and <name type="person">Murray Mason</name>, along with
            received letters and a newspaper extract that they had enclosed to him. The documents,
            which describe the Caste War of Yucatán and its origins, are dated between <date when="--01-30">January 30</date> and <date when="1848-04-15">April 15, 1848</date>.
            They note that <name type="place">Spanish</name> naval ships supplied Yucatán’s
            government with arms and later, joined by a British ship, transported displaced
            Hispanics to safety—and that the breakaway <name type="place">Mexican</name> state’s
            government began asking Perry for arms and other supplies on <date when="--02-01">February 1</date>, echoing a request sent to Washington City on <date when="1847-12-31">December 31, 1847</date>. On <date when="--02-15">February
            15</date>, Perry proposed bringing <abbr>U.S.</abbr> naval ships to the area to protect
            the Hispanics by intimidating the Maya. He proceeded to Campeche, Yucatán, with six
            ships in early March, then departed on <date when="--03-13">March 13</date>, leaving
            Lieutenant Mason in command of a reduced force. On <date when="--04-02">April 2</date>,
            Lieutenant Mason reported that a <abbr>U.S.</abbr> naval ship had begun taking fleeing
            whites aboard and that recently resigned Yucatán governor Santiago Méndez Ibarra wished
            the United States to annex Yucatán and was <pb/>planning similar requests to France,
            Spain, and the <name type="place">United Kingdom</name>. <name type="person">Polk</name>
            transmitted these dispatches and enclosures, along with Secretary <name type="person">Mason</name>’s letter, to the Senate on <date when="--05-09">May 9</date>. While
            debating a bill to authorize the military occupation of Yucatán the previous day, the
            Senate had resolved to ask for all information he had received about events there. See
            all of Secretary <name type="person">Mason</name>’s enclosures in Senate Executive

        <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
        <p>In the paper which I took the liberty of submitting to you this morning, a blank was
          left, to be filled with an extract from <name type="person">Mr. Hannegan</name>’s speech
          in the Yucatan debate. I herewith enclose it, &amp; beg you to have the goodness to affix
          it by a wafer in its place, at the top of the 2d page.<note place="foot" n="1">
                        <name type="person">O’Sullivan</name> enclosed a newspaper clipping of part of <name type="person">Sen. Edward A. Hannegan</name>’s speech of <date when="1848-05-05">May
              5, 1848</date>, during debate over a bill to occupy Yucatán and arm its Hispanic
            residents against the Maya. Hannegan, who supported the bill, warned of a British plan
            to control the Gulf of Mexico by annexing <name type="place">Yucatán</name> and <name type="place">Cuba</name>. <abbr>DLC–JKP</abbr>. The “paper” about purchasing <name type="place">Cuba</name> that <name type="person">O’Sullivan</name> had handed the
            president earlier in the day, to which <name type="person">Polk</name> evidently did not
            attach the clipping, is mentioned in <name type="person">Polk</name>’s diary but has not
            been found.</note>
                </p>
        <p>Pardon me if I profit by the opportunity to add two remarks further.</p>
        <p>1. <name type="place">Cuba</name> is made to furnish a monopoly market to various
          considerable <name type="place">Spanish</name> interests at home; as for instance to the
          farmers in several provinces, whose flour pays a comparatively small duty in <name type="place">Cuba</name>, while ours is taxed $10 a barrel. Again, there are the
          mercantile &amp; shipping interests of the several sea-ports of old <name type="place">Spain</name>, which derive great benefit from their restrictive navigation laws, and
          the existing commercial system between <name type="place">Spain</name> and <name type="place">Cuba</name>. These home influences <pb/>constitute the chief difficulty,
          indeed the only serious one, in the way of the purchase. It is highly important that the
          measure, if done at all, should be done in such a manner as not to arouse the alarm of
          these interests, until too late for their interference, and too late for the national
          pride to be appealed to by them, &amp; invoked not to surrender the last lingering glory
          of <name type="place">Spain</name>’s old dominion &amp; trans-Atlantic empire. Hence the
          mischief of further Congressional discussion; &amp; hence the impolicy of operating at
            <name type="place">Madrid</name> through any mode of agency likely to draw attention,
          either of the public, or of English vigilance, to the object in view. Washington Irving
          would probably not waken much suspicion. Commander Mackenzie, of the Navy, has also twice
          visited <name type="place">Spain</name> as a tourist, and could probably with ease make an
          ostensible pretext for another visit to Madrid. There can be no great difficulty in
          finding a suitable person.</p>
        <p>2. In reference to the purchase-money. Assume 100 millions; paid in a 4 or 5 per cent.
          stock. <name type="place">Cuba</name> would be at first a Territory, and a sufficient
          amount of its present taxation could be kept up to pay off, say 5 millions a year, with
          the interest; and on its admission as a State, the condition would be made of its assuming
          the debt, or providing for it, by its own self-taxation; excepting, of course, such amount
          as should be covered by the crown lands &amp; other property coming to the United States;
          and also the excess of the custom receipts which would be collected there by the
            <abbr>U.S.</abbr> over &amp; above the expenses of collection, for a <pb/>certain
          period. Such portion the <abbr>U.S.</abbr> would rightfully pay. It is at once obvious
          that the whole amount now paid by Cuba to support the large army of Spanish soldiers kept
          up there; and the army of voracious Spanish officials of all sorts, could be transferred
          to the payment of this debt without being felt. Cuba also does the best part of
          maintaining the Spanish navy, the vessels of which are usually sent there to be
          repaired.</p>
        <p>Pardon me if I am obtrusive on this subject; and ascribe it to the earnestness of my
          convictions, feelings &amp; wishes, all warmly enlisted in behalf of the object. If my
          interest in it is also somewhat quickened by a natural anxiety respecting the personal
          safety of some very dear members of my family resident on that island, I beg you to be
          assured that this motive is wholly subordinate to the higher ones, founded on the public
          reasons I have laid before you, by which I have been actuated ever since my visit to <name type="place">Cuba</name>.</p>

        <salute>Dr. Sir/</salute>
        <p>I recd. yours of the 1 inst. some days since advising me to employ <name type="person">Mr. Strickland</name> to look after the execution of the work on your building &amp;c.
          I have thought it over, and come to the conclusion not to act until <name type="person">Mr. Stevenson</name> returns from Augusta (Geo) where he now is, but will soon be home
          again, and be here more or less during the Summer. Hughes is the controlling buildor and
          as Stevenson has set him up pretty much from the point of it’s outset, he is exceedingly
          inclined to do for Stevenson what will be entirely satisfactory—and then he (H.) believes
          that he got your job through Stevenson, and that he (S.) stands pledged for it’s good
          performance; wherefore, it may be best not to <hi rend="italics">weaken</hi> this State of
          responsibility, by a change to <name type="person">Mr. Strickland</name>: A step that
          would needs create some jealousy, &amp; I think, from what I learn, ill will on <name type="person">Hughes</name>’s part.</p>
        <p>As to <name type="person">Mr. Bass</name> complying with the contract in regard to the
          Avenue, there is no hope for it, and Gov. Brown handed me the papers to place into <name type="person">Mr. Nicholson</name>’s hands. I have not done so yet, as N. is in <name type="place">Columbia</name>, but I will act in the matter so soon as <name type="person">Mr N.</name> returns. I saw <name type="person">Jac. McGavock</name>, and
          got the papers I left with him. He feels no interest in squabbling about the matter, but
          could not act, I imagine, without <pb/>incurring the ill will of <name type="person">Mr
            Bass.</name>
          <name type="person">Mr. McG.</name> felt much embarrassment when I read to him the Avenue
          clause, I had left last fall to be inserted in the decree; &amp; I then asked him if there
          could possibly be any objection to it on part of <name type="person">Mr. Grundy</name>’s
          devisees? He replied, that he could see none: Still, I am prepared to say that <name type="person">Mr. Bass</name> will keep it if he can. <name type="person">Mr.
            McGavock</name> seemed to be very willing that the chancellor should settle the matter.
          I will aid <name type="person">Mr. Nicoholson</name> to understand the contract, &amp;
          premises.</p>
        <p>It is melancholy to be driven to such a defence as <name type="person">Mr. Secy.
            Marcy</name> was compelled to make to the charges of Gnl. Scott—and rather wonderful,
          that a man in <name type="person">Scott</name>’s position should so much expose himself
          (to a conviction of some three undoubted falsehoods,) after assuming command just before
          Feby. last, with extreme gratitude to all appearance. The “plate of Soup” letter, I deemed
          a folly of an extremely vain and jealous man, when excited most likely by wine: But this
          Mexico letter of Feby 24, is a deliberate assault on his superiors, and was intended to
          blast them if the writer could, with <hi rend="italics">false</hi> charges; nor do I think
          any well ordered man, <hi rend="italics">of grade</hi>, in the <abbr>U.S.</abbr> will
          think otherwise who reads the two letters. Marcy’s letter displays high vigor, and very
          uncommon ability to deal with facts. I view Scott as deeply disgraced; but I cannot well
          see how you are to deal with him on his return other than to keep him at a distance during
          the remainder of your Term.</p>
        <p>
                    <pb/>
                    <abbr>P.S.</abbr> I have been much afflicted at the death of <name type="person">Ashley</name>, to whom I was considerably attached—&amp; in his confidence.

        <salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
        <p>You will hardly be surprised to get a line dated from me in this capital, after what I
          stated in my last hurried letter.<note place="foot" n="1">
                        <name type="person">Martin</name> to <name type="person">Polk</name>, <date when="1848-04-27">April 27,
              1848</date>.</note> My health &amp; spirits had suffered so much from my long
          confinement in <name type="place">Paris</name>, which I had not left for twenty four hours
          in four years, that I resolved to run over to <name type="place">England</name> for a few
          days, to recruit my constitution, and gather information which may shed light upon the
          duties of my new mission. I have been here hardly two days, and already have I dined in a
          very small company with the celebrated Cobden, with whom I had much instruction &amp;
          interesting conversation &amp; who has kindly promised to procure for me valuable
          documents &amp; information with reference to Italian commerce and duties. I find that his
          heart is set upon the formation of a commercial league in Italy &amp; he informed me, for
          he has lately been in <name type="place">Italy</name> &amp; studied the question, that
          Tuscany &amp; Lombardy, have tariffs, sufficiently liberal &amp; reasonable, to serve as
          models &amp; standards for the <pb/>whole pinensula. I told him that the establishment of
          such a federation, was an object of general interest, &amp; that the policy of the <name type="place">United States</name>, was that which I hoped would soon be generally
          adopted as the easiest as well as the fairest, way, to stipulate for no exclusive
          advantages, but for terms equally advantageous to all who would adopt them. When I left
          Paris two days ago, all was quiet, though much anxiety was felt about the turn that events
          would ultimately take. It is a fearful experiment that the French are making, but such
          have been the moderation &amp; magnanimity displayed by the people hitherto, that I am
          hopeful that it will succeed, even if the nation has to press yet through many trials
          &amp; difficulties. Here there has been a reaction in favor of loyalty. The fast-anchored
          isle seems to strengthen her moorings, as other nations are swinging off. The fact is that
          the social system here is so artificial &amp; complicated, &amp; the enormous wealth of
          the country reposes upon such various &amp; delicate springs, that the community shrinks
          with alarm from every change that threatens confusion. The news from <name type="place">Rome</name>, is interesting but vague. The people are becoming restive under the
          reluctance, honorable from its motive, of the Pope to declare war against <name type="place">Austria</name>. I trust that liberal and moderate councils will prevail. I
          shall remain here, but a short time, &amp; proceed through Paris, to my post. I shall not
          be unmindful of what you say about a layman from Rome for the <name type="place">U.
            States</name>,<note place="foot" n="2">

          though it is a delicate point, on which hitches, by the way, the opening of diplomatic
          relations with <name type="place">England</name>. I shall be able to <pb/>find out some
          thing about it here. Be good enough to present my most cordial compliments to <name type="person">Mrs. Polk</name>, &amp; believe, . . . .</p>

        <salute>Sir</salute>
        <p>The present is one of the most important periods in the history of Our government. Great
          and vital questions agitate the mind of the <name type="place">American</name> people.
          These questions are soon to be desided. The maner in which they are to be Settled is of
          the first importance, as they will have a great influence upon the future happiness and
          prosperrity of Our Nation. Sir the <name type="place">Mexican</name> War which the
          administration have plunged this Republic into for the concealled purpose of propagating
          the damnible instution Slavery will soon meet a merrited vengence from the people of this
          Union. Do you Suppose for One moment that the people is ignorent of the intentions of the
          South in relation to <name type="place">Mexican</name> Territory when admitted into this
          Union and the maner in which the South expect to admit Territory? We are well aware the
          South intind to Exclude <pb/>the Willmot Proviso from being Extended Over Territory to be
          acquired from Mexico. Do you Suppose for one moment that the North will be Silent when you
          Southren dofaces are Striking at the vitals of Expiring Liberty?</p>
        <p>One of you Sothern Do-faces has give notice that he is about to introduce a Bill in the
          House of Representatives for the avowed purpose of Reducing the Press!!! in the Destric of
          Columby to a Sensership. Who would have thought that a Representative of the people of the
          Stars &amp; Stripes would ever be so abandoned and nigardly nobody but a corrupt aspiring
          Demagogue that is ignorent of the unpopularity of Such a proposition. The North will play
          you Sothren gentlemen a lively tune Sir, when she is awakened from her Slumbers and
          compelled to act by asserting her rites.</p>
        <p>Do you Suppose North Can be humbuged in that Stile if you do you are verry much
          mistaking. Sir the next President who will have the Honor to be placed at the Helm of our
          goverment will be a Willmot Proviso man who is Smart who will lern you things present and
          teach you things to come.</p>
        <p>Sir you have vetoed the River &amp; Harbor Bill and by that mistep you have aroused the
          feeling of the north to a lively Since of her duty and the most Sollen<note place="foot" n="1">

        <p>Sir I. whold that whire the Legislature of this government passes a Bill By Such

          Constitutionality of appropriateing moneys <pb/>than the Senate &amp; house of
          Representatives. Sir the North pays 3/4 of the Revinue of this Union and Fancy they have

        <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
        <p>Inclosed you will find a letter from my old German friend, the object of which you will
          perceive and appreciate.<note place="foot" n="2">
                        <name type="person">Hays</name> enclosed
              <name type="person">John P. Helfenstein</name> to <name type="person">Hays</name>,
              <date when="1848-04-26">April 26, 1848</date>. <name type="person">Helfenstein</name>
            therein copies a letter from <name type="place">Washington County</name> (Wisc. Terr.)
              <hi rend="italics">Eagle</hi> editor <name type="person">John A. Brown</name> to <name type="person">Helfenstein</name>, noting the territory’s growing support for Lewis
            Cass since the death of <name type="person">Silas Wright, Jr.</name>, and <name type="person">Brown</name>’s plan for the <hi rend="italics">Eagle</hi> to endorse
            Cass for the Democratic presidential nomination. <name type="person">Helfenstein</name>
            announces his selection as a <name type="place">Wisconsin</name> delegate to the
            Democratic National Convention and his desire to end his candidacy for the
              <abbr>U.S.</abbr> Senate. He asks <name type="person">Hays</name> to recommend him to

              Minisota</hi>” Territory. <abbr>ALS. DLC–JKP</abbr>.</note>
                </p>
        <p>I think it probable (no better one applying) that the appointment <pb/>would be a good
          one, as regards the first planting of democratic principles, in that region. You will of
          course, have better information on the subject, than I can impart to you.</p>
        <p>
                    <name type="person">Mr. H.</name> will be at Baltimore as a delegate from <name type="place">Wisconsin</name>, representing a Cass constituency, but not instructed. In
          many of his letters to me, since your Election, he has expressed an opinion, that a
          “contingency” would occur, that would render it necessary to throw your name again, before
          the country. In that event he is prepared to act. He has lately passed through <name type="place">N. York</name>, where he was satisfied that your name, gave the only chance
          to obtain that vote. He made a special request, for the purpose of ascertaining whether
          you would permit your name voluntarily to be used. On advisement with <name type="person">Mr. Walker</name> &amp; others I did not answer.</p>
        <p>On to day I have written him a letter respectfully acknowledging the receipt of his
          letters—And expressing a hope and expectation that the labors of the convention would
          result, in the selection of the strongest democratic person in the nation, without regard
          to localities or any small circumstance.</p>
        <p>Supposing that <name type="person">T. Martin</name> will be at <name type="place">Washington</name>, I have written a letter of introduction for him &amp; <name type="person">J H. Thomas</name> to hand to him. They will find him a very intelligent
          old man and one from whom, they can obtain much <name type="person">N. Western</name>

        <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
        <p>The gout last Evening prevented my having the honor of writing in you as I was about to
          do when it came on—to report that there is not a word in <name type="person">Napoleon</name>’s historical account of his <name type="place">Egyptian</name> campaign
          of the fiscal and other arrangements by which he subsisted his army there as no doubt he
          did without aid from home.</p>
        <p>I intended also to take the occasion of the enquiry you made of me on this subject to
          submit with great deference my opinion on the very important question of the legality of
          contributions levied in <name type="place">Mexico</name>.<note place="foot" n="2">No
            letter from <name type="person">Polk</name> to Ingersoll about <name type="person">Napoléon Bonaparte</name> or duties in <name type="place">Mexico</name> has been
            found.</note>
                </p>
        <p>I do’nt know whether your attention has ever been drawn to the case of Brown &amp; the
            <abbr>US</abbr>, reported in the 8th Vol. of Cranch page 110. See particularly pages
          125, 6 &amp;c for the opinion of the court as delivered by <name type="person">C. J.
            Marshall</name> and page 149 for Judge Story’s.</p>
        <p>A system of contributions by taxation levied in <name type="place">Mexico</name> would
          be, I think, the most signal merit of the very brilliant hostilities waged there under you
          as commander in chief.</p>
        <p>But it is at least doubtful, when Congress are in Session whether without their act the
          Executive is empowered to do what is necessary. In the case in Cranch the Supreme Court
          considers the powers of Congress to make rules concerning captures on land a <hi rend="italics">substantive</hi> power.</p>
        <p>Should the war continue I submit to your better judgment whether <pb/>the President ought
          not to call on Congress for an act regulating contributions, which, in the present state
          of the two houses there is no reason to apprehand would put a stop to, or do more than
          legalize what you have been doing and may desire to do in <name type="place">Mexico</name>.</p>

        <salute>My dear sir.</salute>
        <p>Although unwilling to add to your labor, or to trespass upon the little time allotted you
          for repose, I cannot forego the inclination to say a few words to you, and they shall be
          few on your own account.</p>
        <p>I am so fully impressed with the expediency, if not real necessity of our government
          making some demonstration on this coast, and of enlarging our Naval force in the
          Mediterranian, for the purpose, first of necessary protection to the citizens and commerce
          of the United States, and secondly on account of the moral influence which it would exert,
          that I have thought it a duty to suggest the subject for your consideration. I have made
          such a recommendation to <name type="person">Mr. Buchanan</name>, <pb/>and stated the
          grounds upon which I did so, but that was an official dispatch, and there are some things
          which may be more freely communicated and perhaps more fully stated in private
          correspondence.</p>
        <p>The <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> is not in active service, and a more
          propitious moment than the present has not occurred perhaps since she was launchd for
          sending her to <name type="place">Europe</name>, and especially to <name type="place">Lisbon, Cadiz</name>, and into the <name type="place">Mediterranian</name>. Of course,
          none more than heretofore, every thing is said and done in <name type="place">Europe</name> to disparage Republics, and any thing which we could do, consistently
          with our policy of neutrality, to vindicate our free system of government is commended no
          less by duty than by sound policy. The masses of Europe have but a very imperfect
          knowledge of our country and her institutions, but have been in some way induced to regard
          it as a land of unparallelled freedom and happiness. Still the biggotted supporters of
          monarchy, seek to make the impression that it is an impracticable abstraction, which
          enjoys but a fleeting existance and which could no where else exist at all, and therefore
          wholly unsuited to <name type="place">Europe</name>. Indeed, these men, either deluded
          themselves or seeking to delude the people, who are now looking out, and almost ready to
          hail for freedom, hold up free government as nothing better than anarchy—the fruitful
          parent of disorder, outrage, robbery—where life, liberty and property have no guarranty
          better than the will of a licentious mob. But notwithstanding these tricks,
          systemmatically practiced upon the people from childhood to old age, the truth will now
          and then reach them, <pb/>and nothing has contributed so much to the prevailing commotion
          in Europe, as the growing influence of our power, our freedom and prosperity.</p>
        <p>I went some weeks ago on board of an <name type="place">American</name> Bark then lying
          in the Tagus, and took with my by invitation of the Captain, <name type="person">Mrs.
            H</name> and our consul here. Amongst the sailors were two <name type="place">Portuguese</name>, who united in giving us a most hearty cheer, and united also in
          singing several good yankee songs as clanish and national as the best yankee could desire.
          It was the only occasion that I have felt happy since I entered this city. They sung with
          a good gusto, and you would have laughed heartily to hear them sing a <name type="person">Jackson</name> song, which run in this way
          <lb type="quote"/><q><name type="person">General Jackson</name>,
            he give them beans <lb type="quote"/>In the battle of <name type="place">New Orleans</name>.</q><lb/> When the flag was taken down in the evening, such was the influence of the days scene
          upon the two <name type="place">Portuguese</name> that they embraced the flag and kissed
          it.</p>
        <p>The <name type="place">Mexican</name> war is I presume now over. It has ended as poor
          Dromgoole once said <name type="person">General Jackson</name> would die, “in a blaze of
          glory” and its prosecution has elevated us abroad far beyond the conceptions of the most
          sanguine minds. And now when our example of free government is shaking monarchy to its
          very foundation, and our Navy has nothing to do, give us an imposing demonstration in
          Europe, and send us that greatest battle ship perhaps in the world (the <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name>) under the command of an experienced and accomplished officer. This
          will be fit, as <pb/>a closing measure of your successful and distinguished
          administration. Believe me sir, that there is no feeling of flattery in this sentiment.
          For whilst I shall continue to entertain a very grateful appreciation of your kindness in
          sending me to Lisbon experience has satisfied me, that both of us were mistaken in
          supposing that it would be a favor to me. Neither is this remark, made in any spirit of
          complaint. In my conscience I believe you have justly entitled yourself to the gratitude
          of our country for a wise, upright and enlightened republican administration which will
          entitle you to a place in the impartial and faithful history of the Union, with the great
          author and founder of our faith. But send out immediately the great Pennsylvania, let her
          enter the Tagus, and look out upon monarchy, and let monarchy and subjects look upon her,
          and neither the commerce of our country, nor the rights of our citizens, nor the arms of
          our consulates, will be trifled with again, during her sojourn in these waters. And may
          that retirement which you now contemplate I doubt not with more real pleasure than you
          left it, be to you one of peace, happiness and prosperity, the sincere wish of . . . .</p>

        <p>To day I intended starting for <name type="place">Washington</name>, but mother would not
          permit me so I have to defer it until tuesday. Mother is far from being out of danger, she
          is in a very critical situation but father is doing his best to releive her, he has
          consulted the most eminent physicians in <name type="place">New York</name> &amp; other
          places and he has received their aprobation of his course as the only one liable to
          releive her. I would not leave her for perhaps I may never see her again &amp; it would be
          hard not to be by the death bed of my only remaining parent. Give my love to aunt <name type="person">Sarah</name>. Ma &amp; father send their love to you &amp; aunt.</p>

        <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
        <p>I was most happy and gratified in receiving your letter of the <date when="--04-15">15th
            of April</date>, accompanying the Joint Resolution of congress, tendering
          congratulations to <name type="place">France</name> on the Revolution. It got to hand on
          the 12th instant, and on the day following I went in person to the new minister of
          <pb/>Foreign affairs as I had not then received official notice of his appointment, to ask
          when I might have the honor of presenting the Resolution to the Executive committee
          appointed by the National Assembly, handing the minister a copy of it. He received the
          communication with great satisfaction, saying that he felt sure the Executive committee
          would appoint an early day for the ceremony.</p>
        <p>This was last Saturday. Up to that day, every thing remained quiet here. On Sunday
          commotions began to be apprehended, and on Monday another Revolution broke out; the
          national Assembly was forcibly invaded by a band of violent people, and its deliberations
          for a time stopped. I can now only refer in a word to this extraordinary state of things.
          There has been no bloodshed, but all Paris was uproar and confusion for two or three days.
          This has doubtless been the reason why I have as yet received no answer to my
          communication.</p>
        <p>It is now Thursday. Order has been restored, and I have waited until the last moments
          thinking that some answer might still come, of the first receipt of which I might apprize
          you; but as this is not the case, I am only able by the present Steamer to say thus much,
          deferring until the next the better Report which, by that time, I shall hope to have it in
          my power to make to the Secretary of State.</p>
        <p>I regard the Joint Resolution of congress, as having arrived very opportunely. Standing
          on the basis and spirit of your letter to me, I will anxiously endeavor, when presenting
          the Resolution to this government, <pb/>to turn the occasion to the best account I can, at
          this precise moment when the violence of Clubs in Paris, and equal violence and rashness
          of the Poles, have been furiously aiming to drive France into foreign wars, and overset
          the very Republic.</p>

          Before this reaches you the convention will have acted and our Candidate will be before

          sufficient to place Your acts, fame &amp;c in its true light.</p>

        <salute>Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>From speculations which have appeared in some of the public journals, and from frequent
          inquiries which have been made of me, by many political friends, some of them Delegates to
          the Democratic National convention which will assemble at <name type="person">Baltimore</name> on the 22nd Instant, I am induced to suppose that it may be the desire
          of some of my friends to propose my re-nomination, as the candidate of the Democratic
          party, for the office of President of the <name type="place">United States</name>. Should
          you <pb/>ascertain that such is the intention of any of the Delegates, I desire through
          you to communicate to the convention that I am not a candidate for the nomination, and
          that any use of my name with that view, which may be contemplated, is without any agency
          or desire on my part.</p>
        <p>The purpose declared in my letter of the <date when="1844-06-12">12th of June
          1844</date>, in accepting the nomination tendered to me by the Democratic National
          convention of that year, remains unchanged, and to relieve the convention from any
          possible embarrassment which the suggestion of my name might produce, in “making a free
          selection of a successor who may be best calculated to give effect to their will, and
          guard all the interests of our beloved country,” I deem it proper to re-iterate the
          sentiments contained in that letter.<note place="foot" n="1">
                        <name type="person">Polk</name> refers to and slightly paraphrases <name type="person">Polk</name> to
              <name type="person">Henry Hubbard</name> et al., <date when="1844-06-12">June 12,
              1844</date>.</note> Since my election I have often expressed the sincere desire which
          I still feel, to retire to private life at the close of my present term.</p>
        <p>I entertain the confident hope and belief, that my Democratic friends of the convention
          will unite in the harmonious nomination of some citizen to succeed me, who if elected,
          will firmly maintain and carry out the great political principles, embodied in the
          Resolutions adopted by the Democratic National convention in <date when="1844">1844</date>, principles, which it has been the earnest endeavour and the constant aim of
          my administration to preserve and pursue, and upon the observance of which in my opinion
          mainly depend the prosperity and permanent welfare of our country. If on reviewing the
          history of my administration, and the remarkable <pb/>events, foreign and domestic which
          have attended it, it shall be the judgement of my countrymen that I have adhered to these
          principles and faithfully performed my duty, the measure of my ambition is full, and I am
          amply compensated for all the labours, cares and anxieties, which are inseperable from the
          high station which I have been called to fill.</p>
        <p>I shall ever cherish sentiments of deep gratitude to my fellow-citizens, for the
          confidence they reposed in me, in elevating me to the most distinguished and responsible
          public trust, on earth.</p>
        <p>It is scarcely necessary that I should add, that it will be no less my duty than it will
          be my sincere pleasure, as a citizen, to unite with my Democratic friends in the support
          of the nominees of the convention for the offices of President &amp; Vice President of the
          United States.</p>

        <salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>I received your letter of the 12th Instant on yesterday. The suggestion which I made to
          you in my letter of the 1st, about the employment of <hi rend="italics">Mr Stickland</hi>,
          the architect, to superintend the building of my House, was made in consequence of a

          the period of making the next payment. I [will] make the next payment promptly at the time
          stipulated (1st of October)—provided the work is sufficiently advanced to insure its
          completion by the <date when="--01-01">1st of January</date>. I have noth[ing] to add to
          what I have heretofore said about the title to the property. I wish you to see <hi rend="italics">Messrs Humphreys</hi>, <hi rend="italics">Nicholson</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italics">Houst[on]</hi> &amp; explain to them the nature of the case, &amp; engage
          them to attend to it, in the chancery Court. The titlle to the property sold by <hi rend="italics">

                    </hi> in his individual right had
          better be made, as it has no necessary connection with the part bought from the <pb/>

          covenants of general warranty, prepared, and have it executed by <hi rend="italics">

        <salute>Dear Sir.</salute>
        <p>The Convention as you will have seen have been in session all day &amp; have accomplished
          a partial organization. There has been &amp; is much confusion &amp; uncertainty, more
          than I supposed. The two third rule will most probably be adopted, but it is not certain.
          The New York case has been referred to a Committee of one from each State, the Committee
          on credentials. This committee have been in session all evening until a few minutes ago
          &amp; have after much discussion &amp; a close vote of one majority come to the
          preliminary decision, not to hear either side unless they would agree to abide by the
          decision &amp; the nomination. Until now there has been not much bitterness but it is now
          becoming very warm &amp; bitter. It is regarded as tantamount to admitting the Old Hunkers
          as they have agreed to bind themselves so, and the BarnBurners it is said have refused to
          submit to any such interrogatories &amp; deny the right of the Convention or Committee to
          interrogate them. It is regarded as a Cass movement and is essentially a Cass triumph, and
          if the Convention should confirm the action of the Committee, which it is probable they
          will, the nomination afterwards made, will be effected amidst much violence &amp;
          mangling. It is probable that if confirmed the Hunkers will come in, the Barnburners will
          go home dissatisfied &amp; denouncing the convention as a pro Slavery packed convention
          &amp; that Cass will then be nominated. The last event is still very uncertain however
          even if the <pb/>Hunkers are admitted, but will depend much upon the adoption of the two
          third rule. Turney, the Committeeman from Tennessee voted &amp; spoke against the right of
          applying any such test. Tennessee will cast her vote on the first ballot 6 for Cass and 7
          scattering, viz 2 for Buchanan &amp; the remaining 5 between Worth &amp; Woodbury. There
          is an interest growing up under the auspices of Blair &amp; the Kentucky delegation for
          Butler. It is impossible to tell how the developements of to night will affect the stock
          in the morning.</p>
        <p>Your true position before the Convention will be presented immediately before any
            ballotting.<note place="foot" n="1">

        <salute>Dear Sir.</salute>
        <p>As I anticipated the entire day on yesterday was devoted to the discussion of the <name type="place">New York</name> case, &amp; the adoption of the two thirds rule.</p>
        <p>I need not write to you anything which you will see in the papers, <pb/>but give
          something of an impression as to what may be the result. Much confusion &amp; no little
          bitterness exists. Unless there is a change &amp; that a decided one, no man ever spoken
          of prominently will stand much chance for a nomination &amp; when made it may not be a
          cordial or unanimous one. I think it will be a very close vote between the confirmation of
          the report of the Committee &amp; the admission of both sets. The chances I think are with
          the latter alternative, that is the admission of both sets with 36 votes. If the
          Barnburners come in, a demonstration will be made pretty early for Gen Butler, prominent
          in whose support will be Hamlin of Maine, Blair &amp; the <name type="place">Maryland</name> delegation, <name type="place">Kentucky</name> &amp; a good many of the
          moderate men, but the probabilities are that he will be brought on too early to be
          successful. The Cass men are becoming very violent, &amp; dispirited.</p>
        <p>I have heard very few intimate a doubt of the good faith of your declaration four years
          ago &amp; ever since of a sincere desire to see a harmoneous nomination of a successor
          &amp; that you may retire to private life.</p>
        <p>An unfortunate remark of Morse of Louisiana brought down upon him a most eloquent &amp;
          scathing castigation from Bowden of Ala. which thrilled through the convention in a tumult
          of applause which was followed up by Hamlin of Me &amp; Rich Thompson of N.J in
          vindication of the Administration. Poor Morse tried to apologise that he did not mean to
          call you an “outsider,” and then Yancy apologised for him. The two-third <pb/>rule was
          much assisted by this scene, for the Louisiana delegation immediately retired &amp;
          changed their purpose &amp; voted for it. They may get to voting to night, but I hardly
          expect it. If they do you will hear of it before you see this. I will write you again
          to-night.</p>

              <date when="--05-14">May 14</date>. The article then asserts, “The departure of [<name type="place">Gideon J.</name>] Pillow about the same time, is said to have been about
            as ludicrous, as the departure of the commander-in-chief was affecting.” Paymaster
            Archibald <name type="person">W. Burns</name>, it adds, “was very conspicuous in this

          <name type="person">L H Coe</name> &amp; others. This same paeper promptly coppies
          everything in its colloms, that he thinks will cast odium upon Genl Pillow. They are not
          actuated by so much Hostility to Pillow as to yourself. There is a secret under currant
          here in opposition to you (not so much to you Administration as to you personally) &amp;
          it has been the case from the announcement of Genl Pillows appointment as Brigr Genl. You

        <salute>Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>I have received your letter of the 4th ultimo. You inform me that the boy <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Joe</name>
                    </hi>, has behaved badly, but that he is at
          home again. I hope that he will remain at home and do his duty. I wish you to release him
          from his confinement, beat him well, and if he leaves you again, I wish you to request <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Leigh</name>
                    </hi> to dispose of him, and procure
          another hand in his place. The draft which <hi rend="italics">

              Leigh</name>
                    </hi> drew on me in your favour for $315.76. has been presented to me and
          has been paid. I have not yet sold my last year’s crop of cotton, and will not do so, at
          the present low prices. As soon as I sell I will inform you of the amount which is due to
          the hands, and will authorize you to pay it over to them. Tell them that they will be sure
          to get their money as soon as the cotton is sold. After you finish cultivating the crop
          this summer, I wish you to employ any time you may have, before the gathering season, in
          clearing more land, as I expect to increase the force for next year. In your next letter I
          wish you to inform me whether the blacksmith <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Harry</name>

        <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
        <p>I have received your favour of the 30th ult. in which you have kindly tendered to me
          office of Attorney General of the <name type="place">United States</name>. I feel very
          sensibly the honour you have conferred on me by selecting me to fill so responsible a
          situation, and one so intimately connected with the Administration of the government. No
          one should be willing to take an appointment by which he is brought into such close
          connection with the Executive, who does not feel that he can cheerfully accord with and
          fully sustain the views and leading policy of the Administration. As to these I have no
          difficulty. I cordially approve them. They have been wise and patriotic, and greatly
          advanced the honor and interests of the whole country.</p>
        <p>I feel, nevertheless, constrained to decline the office, and from motives entirely
          disconnected with public or political considerations. My professional engagements are so
          extended, that I could not abandon <pb/>them, at this time, without great sacrifice. The
          duties also, which I owe my family are such as I may not neglect. These are grounds which
          are imperative in their nature, and upon which it is not needful I should enlarge. Under
          other circumstances it would have afforded me great pleasure to have accepted the
          appointment.</p>
        <p>I beg that you will receive my acknowledgments for this unexpected mark of confidence,
          and believe me to be . . . .</p>

        <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
        <p>I should have written to you on my arrival at <name type="place">Nashville</name> but
          concluded to defer it until it was ascertained whether the Treaty was ratified or
          rejected. The news of its ratification has arrived. Permit me to congratulate you on the
          successful and happy termination of the War. It is the crowning act of your
            Adminstration.<note place="foot" n="2">Here Brown wrote a mark resembling “n” or “h” and
            possibly meant to represent “&amp;.”</note> You can look forward to its close (viz) to
          your Administration with much pleasure, with a proud consciousness of having discharged
          your duty, honestly, faithfully, and efficiently, with the high satisfaction of knowing
          that the character of the American-people for high toned Chivalry for cool, determined,
          bravery, and for all that is ennobling to human nature has advanced as much or more during
          your Administration than any preceding one. It may now with truth and justice be said that
          “we are indeed a great and wonderful people.” I should have remained in <name type="place">Mexico</name> until the ratification of the Treaty, but it was thought very doubtful at
          what time it would be ratified and by many that it would be rejected. Immediately
          preceding my departure from <name type="place">Mexico</name> I received letters advising
          me of the almost entire recovery of my Son and urging upon me that I should return
          immediately and travel with him: his Physicians and friends considering that travelling
          would be more beneficial to him than any thing else and would more speedily bring about
          his entire restoration. I applied to <name type="person">Genl Butler</name> and obtained a
          furlough for 60 days. I suppose my services will not be needed Longer as commissary. If so
          should be glad to be employed in the West without going farther South than Memphis until
          fall. Inasmuch as the War is closed it is unnecessary for me to return to <name type="place">Mexico</name>. I may conclude to meet the Regt between this and <name type="place">New Orleans</name>. Will there be a use for me as Commissary any Longer.
          Should be glad to have some Office more profitable. So soon as my Sons health improves
          sufficiently will take him on North, and will call at <name type="place">Washington</name>
          and close my accounts with the Government. We start to the mountains this week with a view
          to spend several weeks travelling. Hunting fishing &amp;c</p>
        <p>The selection of Cass &amp; Butler as the candidates of the Democratic party has given
          universal satisfaction to the party in this Section of Country. I have not heard the first
          murmur. In fact I doubt whether any other ticket would have been recieved with half the
          inthusiam. Many of the Clay Whigs about <name type="place">Nashville</name> are
          dissatisfied at the nomination of <name type="person">Genl Taylor</name> and say they will
          not vote for him. Among them <name type="person">Doct. B. Mcnary</name>, the most of them
          however will be whipt in by the Election. (Inter nos) Old <pb/>Zac will give us employment
          enough <hi rend="italics">particularly in Tennessee</hi>. I do hope the same Lethargy will
          not prevail here as did Last year. It was the fault of a few of the Leaders of the party
          that we were defeated. If our Electors will do their duty (they are capable) Tennessee I
          think will come out “right side up.” I have written more lengthily than I intended. I
          would transcribe the letter but have not time, you will therefore please excuse mistakes.
          Be obigling enough to present my best respects to <name type="person">Mrs. Polk</name> and

          but be my highest pleasure &amp; duty to co-operate with you in carrying it out.</p>
        <p>Entertaining these views, I am aware of no obstacle in the way of my accepting the place
          tendered me in such flattering terms, &amp; I propose therefore to repair to Washington

        <salute>Dear Sir.</salute>
        <p>I beg herewith to transmit the enclosed documents and correspondence relative to an
          unfortunate error seriously affecting a citizen of the <name type="place">United
            States</name> now resident in Canton, <name type="person">Robert P. De Silver</name>
          <pb/>Esq.<note place="foot" n="1">In <date from="1844-02" to="1844-03">February and March
              1844</date>, <abbr>U.S.</abbr> merchant <name type="person">Cornelius H. Tiers</name>
            purchased tea, for resale, from the Chinese firm Lungke. In <date when="1846-12">December 1846</date>
            <name type="person">Alexander H. Everett</name> sent <name type="person">Polk</name>,
            enclosed in a letter that has not been found, a statement made to <name type="person">Paul S. Forbes</name> by <name type="person">Young Tingqua</name> (or Tingkwa), of
            Lungke, about the transaction. According to <name type="person">Tingqua</name>, <name type="person">De Silver</name> had partnered with Tiers in the purchase and the
            Americans, through deceit, had not paid in full. On <date when="1848-05-23">May 23,
              1848</date>, <name type="person">Parker</name> read that statement to <name type="person">De Silver</name>. With this letter to <name type="person">Polk</name>,
              <name type="person">Parker</name> enclosed six related documents: (1) <name type="person">De Silver</name> to <name type="person">Parker</name>, <date when="1848-05-24">May 24, 1848</date>, in which <name type="person">De Silver</name>
            denies having been a party to the transaction or having been Tiers’s business parter at
            the time, and requests a copy of the accusatory document (<abbr>ALS</abbr>); (2) <name type="person">Parker</name> to <name type="person">De Silver</name>, <date when="1848-05-24">May 24, 1848</date>, a cover letter for the requested copy (L,
            copy); (3) <name type="person">Forbes</name> to <name type="person">De Silver</name>,
              <date when="1848-05-26">May 26, 1848</date>, in which <name type="person">Forbes</name> reports that, on questioning, Tingqua that day said that in 1844 he had
            known that <name type="person">De Silver</name> was not <name type="person">Tiers</name>’s partner and was not involved in the tea purchase (L, copy, in <name type="person">Parker</name>’s hand); (4) <name type="person">De Silver</name> to <name type="person">Parker</name>, <date when="1848-06-13">June 13, 1848</date>, in which
              <name type="person">De Silver</name> enclosed <name type="person">Forbes</name>’s
            letter of May 26 and his own statement about Tingqua’s accusation, asking <name type="person">Parker</name> to file these documents in the legation’s archives and
            then send them to <name type="person">Polk</name> (L, copy, in <name type="person">Parker</name>’s hand); (5) <name type="person">De Silver</name>’s statement, dated
            June 10, in which he claims (a) that in <date when="1844-01">January 1844</date> he
            traveled to <name type="place">China</name> under a business arrangement with Tiers, but
            that not until after the tea purchase—Tiers’s private purchase, not business of <name type="person">Tiers</name>, Bourne &amp; Co.—did he become <name type="person">Tiers</name>’s clerk and then a partner in the firm; (b) that, after returning to the
              <name type="place">United States</name> for his health, <name type="person">Tiers</name> “found that he had been cheated in the teas to a very large amount, and
            refused to pay for them”; and (c) that <name type="person">De Silver</name> and <name type="person">Tiers</name>, <name type="org">Bourne &amp; Co.</name> have “fulfilled”
            their own agreements with Tingqua (D, copy, in <name type="person">Parker</name>’s
            hand); and (6) <name type="person">Parker</name> to <name type="person">De
            Silver</name>, <date when="1848-06-13">June 13, 1848</date>, in which <name type="person">Parker</name> agrees to <name type="person">De Silver</name>’s requests
            and quotes <name type="person">Everett</name>’s letter to <name type="person">Polk</name>: “‘As the transaction out of which the Petition has grown, is wholly of a
            private character, it is beyond the reach of the Executive Department, and nothing can
            be done here but to advise the petitioners to bring their complaint before the courts of
            justice at home in the regular way’” (<abbr>ALS</abbr>, copy). <abbr>DNA–RG</abbr>
            59.</note>
                </p>
        <p>It appears that a private letter addressed you by the late <name type="person">Mr.
            Everett</name>, under date of Dec. 1[6]th<note place="foot" n="2">Possibly “13th”: <name type="person">Parker</name> wrote “3” then wrote “6” over it, or possibly the reverse.
              <name type="person">Alexander H. Everett</name>’s letter not found.</note>
          <date when="1846">1846</date>, enclosing a translation of a Memorial from a Chinese
          Mercantile house, relative to a certain claim (as is represented) upon the firm of Tiers
          Bourne &amp; Co. of Canton, and which mentioned <name type="person">Mr De Silver</name> as
          a partner of <name type="person">Mr. Tiers</name>, at the time of the transaction, has
          come to the knowledge of <name type="person">Mr De Silver</name> through his friends in
          America. In one respect this is fortunate as it affords Mr. De Silver the opportunity of
          correcting the serious mistake into which the Memorialist had fallen, and consequently of
          counter acting the injury which in future the error uncorrected might inflict upon an
          innocent person.</p>
        <p>The request of <name type="person">Mr. De Silver</name> that the correction should be
          filed in the Archives of the Legation and forwarded to the President, is so reasonable and
          just, that I have most cordially complied therewith. Whilst feeling deeply upon the
          subject, his refutation of the charge has been made in a gentlemanly and unimpassioned
          manner, leaving the facts of the case, and the accompanying voucher of <name type="person">Mr. Forbes</name>, to shew the injustice he has sustained.</p>
        <p>How the original error of associating <name type="person">Mr. De Silver</name> with the
          transaction arose does not appear from the questions put to “Tingkwa” by the Consul. But
          as <name type="person">Mr. De Silver</name> was a member of the firm of Tiers <name type="org">Bourne &amp; Co.</name> at the time the memorial was presented, the idea
          probably <pb/>never occurred to <name type="person">Mr. Everett</name> that there was a
          fundamental error in its representing him as such, at the time of the transaction; and
          were he living none would be more prompt to receive the correction, and as far as possible
          to repair the injury it has inflicted.</p>
        <p>The enclosed Statements will remove all the unjust imppressions the error has produced,
          and so far as <hi rend="italics">it</hi> has deprived <name type="person">Mr. De
            Silver</name> of any advantages in the gift of the President, I doubt not that any
          feasible reparation in the power of the goverment will be cheerfully rendered him.</p>

          will support the Compromise.</p>
        <p>I suppose you have heard by Telegraph to-day, that Sevier would reach Vera Cruz by the

        <p>The accompanying papers and printed volume, have been transmitted to me, by <hi rend="italics">Ex. Governor Swain</hi> of <name type="place">N. Carolina</name>, now
          President of the University of that state, with a request that I would forward them to
            you.<note place="foot" n="1">Polk enclosed at least four documents that <name type="person">David L. Swain</name> had sent him: a copy of the Mecklenburg Resolves,

            had been sent to the Second Continental Congress; and the “printed volume.” Neither the

            in <name type="person">Joseph Knox Walker</name>’s hand. <abbr>DLC–JKP</abbr>.</note>
          <hi rend="italics">Mr. Swain</hi> has been for some time engaged in making researches,
          into the early history of the two <name type="place">Carolinas</name>. The Declaration of
          Independence by the people of Mecklenburg on the <date when="1775-05-20">20th of May
            1775</date>—and their Resolves, passed on the 31st of the same month are interesting
          events. <hi rend="italics">Mr Swain</hi> whom I saw a year ago, when on a visit to the
            <pb/>
                    <name type="org">University of <abbr>N.C.</abbr>
                    </name> thinks it more than
          probable that the Reports of the Colonial Governor (<hi rend="italics">Martin</hi>) to his
          Government, may be found among the archives of the Brittish Government. If he is right in
          this, and you could obtain copies, or the substance of these Reports, they would be very
          interesting, especially, to the people of the two Carolinas.</p>
        <p>I have not written to you for many months, first because I had nothing of interest to
          communicate, and secondly because there has been no relaxation of my labours since you
          left. Every moment of my time is occupied, and I am compelled to neglect almost entirely,
          my correspondence with my friends.</p>
        <p>It may I think be regarded as certain that there is peace with <name type="place">Mexico</name>. A despatch recived from <hi rend="italics">Messrs Sevier &amp;
            Clifford</hi> under date of the 25th ultimo at Queretero, announcs the fact of the
          ratification of the Treaty by both branches of the Mexican Congress.<note place="foot" n="2">
                        <name type="person">Polk</name> refers to <name type="person">Ambrose H.
              Sevier</name> and <name type="person">Nathan Clifford</name> to <name type="person">James Buchanan</name>, <date when="1848-05-25">May 25, 1848</date>, which announces
            the Mexican Senate’s approval of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that day, leaving only
            the exchange of ratifications to complete the process. Senate Executive Document No. 60,
            30th Congress, 1st Session, p. 72.</note> All that remained to be done, was the formal
          exchange of ratifications, which would probably take place in two or three days, from the
          date of their despatch.</p>
        <p>The Presidential contest promises to be a violent one. Factions of each party, are not
          satisfied with their respective nominees. The <name type="place">New York</name>
          <hi rend="italics">Barnburners</hi> are producing great embarrassment in the Democratic
          party. They are highly excited &amp; I fear irreconcilable. The great probability is that
          their course will ensure the vote of <name type="place">N. York</name> to the Whig
          candidate. I am however confident that the Democracy can elect <hi rend="italics">Genl.
            Cass</hi> without the vote of <name type="place">New York</name>. I hope they may be
          able to do so.</p>
        <p>
                    <pb/>I am rejoiced that I shall soon retire from the incessant labours, cares and
          anxieties of my office, which as you know have been very great during my whole term. With

        <salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>You will be informed by the Secretary of State that I have acceded to your wishes to be
          recalled from your mission. <hi rend="italics">Senator Bagby</hi> of Alabama has been
          nominated to the Senate &amp; been confirmed by body as your Successor. <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Bagby</name>
                    </hi> thinks he will be ready to sail from the
            <name type="place">United States</name>, sometime between the middle and last of July. I
          have informed him of your desire to leave <name type="place">St. Petersburg</name> early
          in August, and he will on that account hasten his departure. I have by and with the advice
          and consent of the Senate appointed your son <hi rend="italics">

                    </hi> is anxious that he should remain with him. I hope
          he will do so. Should he desire to return to the U. Stats, in the course of a few months,
          he would of course be permitted to resign the situation. His intimate acquaintance with
          the business of the Legation, will enable him to be very useful to <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Bagby</name>
                    </hi>, especially for the first months after he

        <p>I have received your letter of the 5th Instant,<note place="foot" n="1">Letter not
            found.</note> and am under renewed obligations to you for your kind attention to my

          title under the tax sale is void as long as the tax receipts may be preserved. These are
          however liable to be lost, and his Deed is recorded, it is desireable in order to avoid
          future difficulty that he should execute a quit claim Deed to me. This he ought to be
          willing to do cheerfully and without compensation. Rather than fail to get the Deed
          however, it would be better to pay him a small sum. I suppose he paid but a nominal price
          at the <name type="person">Sheriff</name>’s sale. This I would be willing to refund to
          him, though he is not justly entitled to it. I desire to secure the services of <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Marrs</name>
                    </hi> for the next year, and I am
          willing to pay him the same wages ($500.) for his services, which he receives for this
          year. I will thank you to engage him at that rate, &amp; to close the contract with
          him.</p>
        <p>The boy <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Joe</name>
                    </hi> I am satisfied will do me
          no good. When he shall be again reclaimed, I concur with you in opinion that I ought not
          to retain him. He has been treated well, but he may be better satisfied to live with some
          one else. If you can do so, I will be obliged to you to dispose of him for me, and if an
          opportunity offers, to purchase another hand in his place.</p>
        <p>Like yourself, I have not yet sold my cotton &amp; will not do so at present prices. I
          hope the present troubled state of affairs in <name type="place">Europe</name> may be of
          short duration. When they are over, we may expect better prices.</p>

        <salute>Mr President</salute>
        <p>
                    <pb/>I have hesitated a long time as to the propriety of addressing you a letter but I
          trust you will excuse the liberty and the intrusion. Your friendly offers to me when I had
          the pleasure of seeing you have induced me to trouble you with one or two requests. Since
          my return from <name type="place">Mexico</name> I find myself out of employment and almost
          out of means and urgent necessity compels me to ask for favours from <name type="place">Washington</name> (where my unsettled business at this time prevents me from going as I
          would wish). I have been informed that there was a probability of some two or three
          mounted regiments being raised to act in this portion of the country and on the Rio Grande
          line. If such be the case, I solicit the command of one of them. If there is to be an
          expedition to <name type="place">Calafornia</name> (as is reported) or a command raised to
          open a military road I would be much gratified to be appointed to It. I have an intimate
          knowledge of the whole Country from the coast to near Chihuaha and might be of service in
          exploreing the route to that country. Any service the President may render me will be ever
          most gratefully remembered by this . . . .</p>

        <p>Believing, that the enclosed,<note place="foot" n="2">The enclosed circular, dated <date when="1848-07-04">July 4, 1848</date>, expresses Americans’ “indebtedness to France
            for” its support in the Revolutionary War and their “profound admiration” for <name type="place">France</name>’s recent “mighty and almost bloodless revolution” and
            attendant “regard for the rights of property and person.” It then outlines for the
            “sister Republic” ten “great principles illustrated in our history”: (1) that Americans’
            commitment to the Bible enabled the writing, adoption, and preservation of the
            Constitution; (2) that <abbr>U.S.</abbr> officials “recognise[d] the government of God”;
            (3) that they honored the Sabbath; (4) that “they ordered . . . the importation of many
            thousand copies of the Bible”; (5) that, at <name type="person">Benjamin
            Franklin</name>’s suggestion, the authors of the Constitution sought God’s “guidance”;
            (6) that the government has begun each day by seeking God’s guidance; (7) that Americans
            established “freedom of opinion, freedom of speech, freedom of the <pb/>press, and
            freedom to worship God according to the dictates of conscience”; (8) that “All religious
            denominations have effectual and equal protection, but none are in any way connected
            with the government, nor are their ministers paid out of the public treasury”; (9) that
            Americans’ “peace, and harmony, and happiness” owe much to their making the Bible “the
            Family Book of the masses”; and (10) that “the temperance reformation” has conserved
            money, “reclaimed” “many inebriates,” fostered “productive industry,” reduced “crime and
            pauperism,” and “increased prosperity.” The circular concludes with “the hope that God
            may so guide and direct the National Assembly in their councils, and the Nation in its
            acts, as to secure for the future to your Republic, peace, and freedom, and universal
            prosperity.” Despite <name type="person">Delavan</name>’s request, it does not bear

          the fourth of July next letters were prepared at this office to give effect to the
          decision, and sent to Gen Henderson the Chairman, for his signature. Under the conviction
          that he had replaced the communications as he found them, the envelopes were not opened on
          being returned, but were sealed and immediately sent to the Post office.</p>
        <p>I learn with deep regret that in the hurry of the transaction, those communications were
          placed by him, in envelopes to which they did not belong. Be pleased to receive this as an
          apology for the error to repair which I send you duplicate of the invitation, intended to
          have been sent to you before.<note place="foot" n="2">

        <salute>My Dear Sir,</salute>
        <p>I regret that my apparent obstinacy in holding on to my late office should have given you
          the anxiety I am assured it has. I would have resigned long ago could I have done so
          honorably.</p>
        <p>At the head of the few, personally insignificant, persons, who, by unwearied importunity
          &amp; misrepresentation, obtained the host of names for Dunlap, are the Post master of
          this City &amp; Clapp, who holds his place, by means of money &amp; like servile
          importunity, for a scrap, to Congress, and were much elated by Dunlaps success. But the
          report, let out by <name type="person">Mr Moore</name>, that an appointment on the
          Commission to pass on the Mexican claims would be offered me, has depressed &amp; greatly
          disturbed them. They dread, as is said, my presence at Washington &amp; it is supposed may
          make an effort to prevent your offering me this place.</p>
        <p>It is possible they may have the presumption to do so, &amp; even get our Delegation in
          Congress to get up some other name, “to head you off” in this as they say they have done
          in the other case. Hamblin is hostile, for my name was used against him as Senator two
          years ago, Bradbury is selfish &amp; with the others I have very slight acquaintance, they
          are not men of whom I ever have or can ask a favour.</p>
        <p>I do not like to appear importunate, but, under existing circumstances, I should be
          doubly gratified to receive from yourself the appointment in proposed Mexican Commission,
          &amp; trust that no efforts of these men, should they have the assurance again to assail
          you, will divert you from the favourable intentions you have expressed toward me.</p>

          is a suspension from the performance of the duties of my desk an an Asst Examiner in the
          Patent Office and I presume is a step taken by The Commr of Patents in consequence of the
          charges presented by me against him to The Hon Secy of State. Sir I trust that you will
          not countenance in <name type="person">Mr Burke</name> the exercise of a power similar to
          that you refused to tolerate in <name type="person">Gen Scott</name> when Gen Worth
          <pb/>preferred charges against him. Upon your action then I ground my hope that you will
          order me to be restored to my desk and no action taken against me until the charges I have
          made have been thoroughly investigated. A copy of these charges I have the honor to
            enclose.<note place="foot" n="2">In this petition to <name type="person">James
              Buchanan</name>, dated <date when="1848-06-15">June 15, 1848</date>, <name type="person">Clinton</name> prefers twenty-one charges against Burke, in sum accusing
            the commissioner “of fraud bribery corruption embezzlement felony and malfeisance in
            office.” The charges include (1) “approving and paying a bill or bills, not allowing it
            or them to be examined in the usual way; this bill or these bills being knowingly
            wilfully and fraudulently designed and constructed so as to pass the accounting Officers
            of the Treasury”; (2) sending patentees’ inventions “to Europe by A[lexander].
            Vattemore; by which act these patentees are deprived of any emoluments they might derive
            from the possession of patents for the same when taken out in Europe”; (6) “Granting
            illegally and wilfully patents which ought not to be granted and refusing others which
            ought to be granted”; (13) nominating for examiner men who had not served as assistant
            examiner, thus “Violating the spirit and tradition of the Law of 1839,” which created
            the training position of assistant examiner; (17) “General neglect of the business of
            the Office and appropriation of the business hours to political &amp; personal writing
            . . . and employing his subordinates during Office hours on his own personal or private
            affairs”; (18) “General absence from the Office during Office hours, [and] coming late
            and going early”; (20) “Exercising generally a tyrannical deportment and insolent
            bearing towards his subordinates in Office; subjecting them to his oaths, illtemper and
            caprice; and threatening to turn them out on false and insulting charges”; and (21)
            “Prostituting the office to purposes of personal aggrandizement by employing Editors and
            letter-writers, giving them all license in hours (so that one can report Congressional
            news for his paper) and in performance of clerical duties; permitting them to take
            papers out of the Office; to publish news-paper puffs personal to himself and then and
            in the above way rewarding them.” Clinton calls for “a thorough examination into the
            affairs of the Patent Office” and asks Buchanan to ensure “that the personelle of the
            Patent Office be not tampered with and that the records and papers of the same be not
            destroyed altered or withdrawn.” <abbr>ANS</abbr>, copy. <abbr>DLC–JKP</abbr>.</note>
          Having referred <name type="person">Mr Burke</name>’s letter to the Hon Secy of State it
          has been returned to me as containing matter not germain to his control. I now present it
          for consideration to your Excellency and ask your earliest action thereon. The Hon Secy of
          State having sent a copy of my charges against the Commr of Patents to him for explanation
          I do not deem it respectful to the Secy of State for me to do more than furnish your
          Excellency with a copy of the charges as explanatory of the cause of the Commr’s letter to

        <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
        <p>My son <name type="person">J Albert</name> was in Madison during the canvass for <name type="place">United <pb/>States</name> Senators, he went on as the friend of Judge Dunn
          who he says should have been Elected. Judge Dunn was and is the friend of the
          Administration, supports it in all its measures, and was too independent to pledge himself
          for the Wilmot proviso as those did who were elected. Govr. <name type="person">Dodge</name>’s Election was obtain’d by his visiting in person nearly all the Members
          of the Legislature immediately after the Election, and pledg’d himself for the Wilmot
          proviso, this secured his Election, altho if left without this pledge would have been in
          the Manority about 15 votes. Walker is also pledg’d for the Wilmot proviso.</p>
        <p>Having now before you how these men will moove on the Wilmot proviso question, you can
          judge what will be their action on other questions that will closely interest your other
          measures—this may appear strange after the result of the last state Election, when the
          Democracy carried the State by 5000 a Majority—this is in some measure accounted for, when
          I say, <name type="place">New York</name> influence has had much to do in it.
          Notwithstanding this U States Senator Election, the real Democracy has the Voice of the
          people with them, and will in all after Elections prove it so. This <name type="place">New
            York</name> influence has given us much trouble, and rises up at every time it finds the
          friends of the admn. asleep—Cunning, shrew &amp; designing, a watchful care must be
          observ’d.</p>
        <p>Since the Nomination of Van Buren &amp; Dodge by the Utica convention, all is quiet here,
          and these men who labour for <name type="place">N York</name> influence are quiet waiting
          to see popular opinion—before we moove, we <pb/>desire to see action on the part the Barn
          Burner influence here, this ever fully developig itself will be suitably met. Our United
          States Senators as also our representatives have a precarious part to act, their after
          continuence in office will depend on their action in Congress.</p>
        <p>Having now plainly and [naritively]<note place="foot" n="1">Word uncertain.</note> given
          you the course of action of our Representatives, you are the better able to regulate
          yourself with them. I gave you my views about our Representatives in a former note,<note place="foot" n="2">Helfenstein may refer to his letter of <date when="1848-06-07">June

        <p>It is my painful duty to transmit to you the enclosed letters from <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr. R. C. Pearson</name>,</hi> announcing the distressing and

          will be able to bear it, with christian fortitude. Both your parents are now gone, and I

          feel. You must reconcile yourself to your condition, and continue steadily to pursue your

        <p>Your aunt requests to be remembered kindly to you. She sympathises with you, in your

        <salute>Sir</salute>
        <p>I desire to countervail any statements to the effect that the Grand Jury have
          “triumphantly acquitted” <name type="person">Mr Burke</name> of any charges. I have reason
          to beleive the case is not dismissed. Not having it in my power improperly to command
          information I can only say that as far as I can judge from queries put to me that it is
          not the facts but the laws that do not seem to reach the case. That the Subtreasury or
          other laws may not do so, is <name type="person">Mr Burke</name>’s luck and not my fault.
          To end this matter, Sir, please let the accused and the accuser meet face to face before
          some <pb/>competent and public board of Examiners authorized by you to investigate these
          charges through all their bearings. The Hon Secy of State (as I learned from <name type="person">Mr J. Knox Walker</name>) although authorized by you to investigate these
          charges, has to this day left me without letter or line from him upon the subject. My
          movements elsewhere were the consequence and were so shaped (much to my detriment) as not
          to interfere with Executive Action. I now formally ask your Excellency to take cognizance
          of these charges and bring them before some tribunal for investigation.</p>

        <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
        <p>In behalf of numerous friends in the state of <name type="place">New York</name> I
          recommend &amp; urge the removal <hi rend="italics">at once</hi> of such prominent federal
          office holders in that state as are engaged in attempting to defeat the nominees of the
          late Democratic National Convention. If this is not done, whatever the alleged reason may
          be, it is a practical concession that they are so far right &amp; the Democratic party in
          its chosen agents so far wrong that their <pb/>hostility must be endured by the party who
          furnish the position &amp; the means for their own assault. So far as I know or believe
          there is not a single democrat in the state who is not anxious for their removal. By
          “democrat” I mean those who support the measures &amp; candidates of the party &amp; not
          those who support either Hale or Van Buren.</p>
        <p>If this defection is different from all others it may perhaps require a treatment I do
          not understand but if it is like those which have gone before it its mischief will be best
          prevented by treating it as other defections have been treated. The disorganisers will
          vote against the party in any event—they cannot do more if repudiated by the
          administration. Besides should it be seen that the administration marked them by its
          disapprobation they could not hereafter lead astray those who have honest intentions but
          are as weak as they (the leaders) are wicked &amp; shameless. No campaign can be fought in
            <name type="place">New York</name> under present circumstances for our most efficient
          men refuse to move. I am aware that some may found who recommend a different course but
          they either know nothing about it—sympathise with the defection, or lack moral courage to
          do right lest they may be accused of doing wrong.</p>
        <p>I intended to have seen you but cannot this morning &amp; begging for early action I send
          you this very hasty &amp; seemingly familiar note which I hope you will excuse.</p>

        <p>The bearer, <name type="person">Alphonso M. Sumner</name>, was emancipated many years
          since by a relative of mine, <name type="person">Thos. E. Sumner</name>, of <name type="place">Williamson County, Tennessee</name>. He has for many years taught school in
            <name type="place">Cincinnati, Ohio</name>. He is anxious to visit <name type="place">Liberia</name>, for the purpose of obtaining information of the country which may be
          useful to his colored bretheren in the <name type="place">United States</name> who may
          wish to emigrate to that country. His means are limited, and he wishes to know whether he
          will be permitted to go, in any capacity, in any one of the Goverment vessels which may be
          ordered to the coast of <name type="place">Africa</name>. Alphonso had testimonials of his
          uniform good deportment from many highly respectable gentlemen, to which I desire to add
          my own. I have no doubt but that the favor, should he be permitted to go as he desires,
          will be properly appreciated by him, and that it will redound to the welfare of the free
          colored population of our country.</p>

          perfectly satisfied, the spirit and <pb/>intent of the Subtreasury law has been violated,
          but that as the law is either too specific or too little so they prefer not to present
            <name type="person">Mr Burke</name>. Were the law plainer or did it not say so
          distinctly that the Officer must “convert to his own use” or use “by way of investment,
          loan &amp;c &amp;c” nothing would stand between <name type="person">Mr Burke</name> and an
          indictment. The Grand Jury may yet present him, but I think they will not—and there are
          minor reasons besides, for not doing so. The Executive and Congress can more fully
          investigate <hi rend="italics">the whole</hi> of the charges, the Grand Jury is of a
          different political complexion from <name type="person">Mr Burke</name>, and the language
          of the law is too specific for them to feel certain that <name type="person">Mr
            Burke</name> could not slip through its loop-holes; when it would be said they presented
          him because they disliked his politics.</p>
        <p>I fully agree with the Grand Jury in the impressions I conclude they have taken.</p>
        <p>The House committee on Patents meet to day for the first time since the presentation of
          my petition.</p>

        <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
        <p>Hughs is making good progress with your house &amp; I think will finish it in time and in
          good style. The directions to finish off another front are consider’d very judicious. I
          examined &amp; found that three or four lotts can be laid off &amp; sold on the west,
          without detriment to the balance of the premises for some Six or Eight thousand dollars
          according to the payments. Nicholson I suppose has written you in relation to the
          probability of a compromise about the title.<note place="foot" n="2">
                        <name type="person">Alfred O. P. Nicholson</name> to <name type="person">Polk</name>, <date when="1848-06-01">June 1, 1848</date>.</note> I have not attended much to <hi rend="italics">that</hi> subject because I have been confined allmost constantly with
          the most afflicted family I have ever had. For two weeks I have not pretended to go to bed
          &amp; even now am in some degree doubtful as to my youngest child.</p>
        <p>In relation to politics—the nominations—probable result of the comeing election in the
          State, I have but little to say beyond the expression of opinion that the State is in a
          very salvable condition. My own position is a very disagreeable one. Many of my personal
          friends believe that I have devoted enough of my time, health &amp; means to former
          elections &amp; I find it difficult to persuade them that I have not been strangely
          pretermitted if not neglected in the distribution of honors &amp;c. Beside this if I pour
          my accustomd energies into this election there are certain democrats who look forward to
          advancement from Cass when <pb/>elected who would be likely to become jealous of me if I
          became too prominent in the canvass. Added to these considerations, the Whig leaders here
          (you know them) are beginning to whisper already, that the only reason why I would consent
          to perform so much labor must be, that having been disappointed in not getting any thing
          under your administration I am disposed to make a desperate struggle to succeed better
          under the approaching one. Now these insinuations are annoying to my friends and are well
          calculated to lessen my efficiency in this canvass. When I consented to accept it, I did
          not know but it might have to be faught on the old issues of <date when="1844">1844</date>
          both as to persons &amp; measures &amp; not being willing to see it fall on the hands of
          those I knew to be disaffected &amp; disinclined to let the State sustain its own Citizen,
          I consented to take it to prevent such a result. But those I have so long delighted to
          cooperate with &amp; to serve, are now no longer interested &amp; I lack motive for
          encountering so hard &amp; so severe a contest, except what simply arises from the desire
          to advance my principles. You remember that I adverted to this peculiarity of my position
          in a former letter &amp; suggested that the mere <hi rend="italics">offer</hi> of some
          high position with your administration which I should certainly decline, would have a good
          effect to remove the stifled dissatisfaction of some of my friends &amp; disarm my enemies
          of their insidious mode &amp; subject of attack,<note place="foot" n="3">Letter not
            found.</note> &amp; I am free to state, that on the occurance of several important
          missions &amp; vacancies lately, putting it in your power, I have felt like my suggestion
          attracted too little <pb/>of your attention &amp; my embarrassments too little of your
          sympathy. But it is too late now to apply any such remedy &amp; I regret that I ever made
          the suggestion. I have to make a bloody fight for 3 or 4 months with Govr. <name type="person">Jones</name>, <name type="person">Jno Bell</name> &amp; Gentry, all
          stimulated, to their utmost pitch by the hopes of reward—whilst I bear the taunts of
          former supposed neglect &amp; the rival jealousy of some of my own party. In short I have
          succeeded to all your former troubles &amp; trials in the State, with an infernal set of
          party leaders against me &amp; with a decided falling off of the strong men which you then
          had to support you. <name type="person">Jackson</name> dead, you abstracted necessarily
          from the field of labor—Armstrong gone—&amp;c &amp;c. Not to say any thing of the
          disappointed &amp; disaffected, who if they do nothing against us, do but little for us.
          Tennessee will be a great battle ground &amp; such men as Baylie Peiyton, Yerger &amp;
          others will be <hi rend="italics">imported</hi> upon me. These are the circumstances by
          which I am to be surrounded, to say nothing of the total destitution of funds essential to
          the canvass &amp; much of which it is doubtless expected I will furnish &amp; add to the 4
          or $5.000 I have already paid in the last two canvasses of the State, some of which was to
          make up deficiencies in the payment of some individuals in your elections &amp; which
          individuals are now basking in the sunshine of the best offices at your disposal
          abroad.</p>
        <p>I never wanted to get into the vortex of our State elections &amp; I never wanted office
          under your administration. But I did seek a connection with the New paper to be establishd
          as your organ at Washington<note place="foot" n="4"><name type="person">Brown</name> to <name type="person">Polk</name>, <date when="1845-01-05">January 5, 1845</date> (first such letter); <name type="person">Brown</name> to <name type="person">Polk</name>, <date when="1845-01-06">January 6, 1845</date> (second such letter).</note>, but <name type="person">Mr. <pb/>A.

        <salute>My dear Sir</salute>
        <p>The people in the west are excited to some extent on the subject of the Presidential
          election, but less than they have been at any former election for twenty years. The whigs
          are striving to excite the people for <name type="person">Genl Taylor</name>, but it wont
          work. They are flored in a moment when we call on his principles, when we ask how many
          negroes he Ownes, what are his opinions on the improvement of Harbour &amp;c (The slope)
          at once. But misary loves company (you know) and when we tell them that the whig farmers
          are opposed to <name type="person">Taylor</name> they say they are aware that both
          nominations are objectionable. In this city of anti slavery men, and many rank
          abolitionists, we have some Trouble, &amp; <name type="person">Martin Vanburen</name> with
          his <name type="person">Barn Burning</name> faction, will be remembered &amp; marked while
          his head is <hi rend="italics">hot</hi>. If ever a man Truckled to catch Southern votes it
          was <name type="person">Martin V</name> &amp; his ingratitude to the South and his
          democratic friends in the north and west deserves the execration of all honest democrats.
          I have gone all <pb/>lengths to support sustain and defend him But I am done with him
          forever.</p>
        <p>There is One thing worthy of profound consideration. <name type="person">Martin
            Vanburan</name> &amp; his party can have no prospect of electing their man (whether he
          or some other) and their prime object is nothing less or more than to defeat <name type="person">Genl Cass</name> and elect <name type="person">Genl Taylor</name>. At the
          bottom of this plot is the foundation of a sectional party that is to overwhelm the South.
          The leaders boast that the prime object of electing <name type="person">Taylor</name> is
          to make the South and <hi rend="italics">slavery</hi> as Odious as practicable. In this
          view of the matter what should the South do? It is due to the west to have the President.
          The South should at once see that to defeat all the <hi rend="italics">plots</hi> and <hi rend="italics">schemes</hi> laid by <name type="person">Vanburan</name> and whigery
          united, would be blown skie high in the election of <name type="person">Genl Cass</name>
          who would make a national and not a sectional President. I know your official station
          should have forbidden me to address to you a politial epistle, But my dear Sir knowing me
          you well know how to excuse it. Remembr howevr that Ohio will go for Cass and that the
          efforts of a litle ineficent paper here whose edittor is evidently strongly Tinctured with
          abolition can amout to but little. It is small potatoes and the only democratic paper in
          the state that has bolted.</p>
        <p>The western reserve has determind against Taylor and he will loose that strong federal
          vote that always gave us trouble in <name type="place">Ohio</name>.</p>

        <salute>Sir</salute>
        <p>It is due to myself and not disrespectful to you for me once more to approach you and
          call your attention to the appeal I made to you on the 26th June last, against the act of
          the Commr of Patents suspending me from my duties simply because I dared to prefer charges
          against him. I am at a loss to conceive what crime I have committed by so doing, and still
          more so to understand upon what principles, having justice and duty for their basis, that
          act of the Commr’s can be sustained or allowed to remain in force. Page 5, Nos 3 and 4 of
          the enclosed pamphlet contains a printed copy of the appeal.<note place="foot" n="1">Enclosure not found.</note> I understand this afternoon that <name type="person">Mr
            Burke</name> has actually placed a <name type="person">Mr Cooper</name> at my desk
          whether temporarily or not I did not hear. Will this too, Sir, be allowed?</p>
        <p>It may be said, though not very deductively, that I subsequently asked and you granted a
          board to examine the charges which called forth this letter of suspension.<note place="foot" n="2">

            letter were enclosed in <name type="person">Clinton</name> to <name type="person">Polk</name>, <date when="1848-06-26">June 26, 1848</date>.</note> Sir, I did ask for
          a competent and public board of Examiners and you granted such a commission as it lay
          within your power to institute (for which I thank you). But, unfortunately it was found
          and admitted by the Commissioners themselves that you could not <pb/>under any law, with
          which they were acquainted, grant them competent powers. They could not summons witnesses,
          compel the attendance of persons, nor the production of papers. They could not even
          administer an oath. And besides there sat before them the Commr of Patents in the control
          of all the Officers and in the possession of all the papers of the Patent Office. Under
          these circumstances should it not be that I ought to go where the necessary powers do
          exist? Even the Commr has stated in writing his intention (forced from him by my petition)
          to demand an investigation by Congress. And yet neither of these points touch the question
          of my appeal to you against the Commrs suspension of me. If any one should be suspended,
          is it not the accused who should be so treated?</p>
        <p>Sir, please excuse the plain language of an American Citizen who says he intends to come
          out of this matter of charges against the Commr of Patents in a manner satisfactory to the
          consciences of every honest man and who, to that end, in this point of suspension throws
          himself under the power and sense of justice of The President of <name type="place">The
            United States</name> by renewing his appeal.</p>

        <salute>Sir:</salute>
        <p>I have the honor to communicate, herewith, a letter from the Commissioner of the General
          Land Office, with accompanying statements A and B, containing so much of the information
          called for in the resolution referred by you to this department, as it has been in my
          power to procure at present.<note place="foot" n="1">
                        <name type="person">Polk</name>
            enclosed this letter, with its enclosures, in his <date when="--07-24">July 24</date>
            message responding to the <abbr>U.S.</abbr> House’s resolution of July 10; see letter
            and notes in <name type="person">Polk</name> to <name type="person">Walker</name>, <date when="1848-07-17">July 17, 1848</date>. <name type="person">Richard M. Young</name> to
              <name type="person">Walker</name>, <date when="1848-07-18">July 18, 1848</date>,
            enclosed with this letter, is a cover letter for the two statements. Statement A, dated
            July 17 at the General Land Office, gives the “extent of Texas, taking the Rio Grande to
            its source, and thence to the parallel of 42° north latitude, as the western boundary,”
            using John Disturnell’s <hi rend="italics">Mapa de los Estados Unidos de Méjico</hi>.
            Statement B, titled “Extracts from the Texas papers of <date when="1845">1845</date>,”
            uses “the limits defined by statute of the first Texan congress.” <abbr>PL</abbr> and
              <abbr>PDs</abbr>. Published in House Executive Document No. 70, 30th Congress, 1st
            Session, pp. 9–10.</note>
                </p>
        <p>The statement B is believed to contain a correct abstract of the official report from the
          land office of Texas, in <date when="1845">1845</date>, to the convention which framed the
          constitution of that State. It will be perceived by that report, that the superficies of
          Texas, assuming the boundary fixed by the laws of that State, is about 397,000 square
          miles, or 254,248,166 acres; whereas the area of Texas, with the same boundary, according
          to Disturnell’s map, and the calculation of the Commissioner of our General Land Office,
          is 325,529 square miles, or 208,332,800 acres.</p>
        <p>The territory of <name type="person">California</name> and <name type="person">New
            Mexico</name>, west of the Rio Grande, acquired by the treaty with <name type="place">Mexico</name>, is estimated, according to Disturnell’s map, and by the Commissioner of
          our General Land Office, at 526,078 square miles, or 336,689,920 acres.</p>
        <p>By statement B it would appear that the whole amount of Mexican grants, within these
          assumed limits of <name type="place">Texas</name>, is estimated at their land office at
          22,080,000 acres, “a portion of which is supposed to be invalid.”</p>
        <p>
                    <pb/>If the proportion of Mexican grants should be the same in the territory above
          referred to, west of the Rio Grande, it would leave the amount of public domain in that
          territory nearly equal to 468,750 square miles, or three hundred millions of acres.</p>
        <p>This department has not been able to obtain any authentic information as to the extent of
          Mexican grants within this territory, west of the Rio Grande. It is believed, however, to
          be very small, except within the most western slope, fronting on the Pacific.</p>

        <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
        <p>Suffer me, although trembling beneath the infirmities of almost fourscore years, to
          address a few words to you. We who have so long sat dumb with grief would open our lips.
          We would express the gratitude of our burdened hearts. Our Son that was lost is found. He
          has exchanged the noxious air of a dungeon for the pure breath of Heaven among these
          granite hills. He is with us to cheer us, to comfort us in the decline of life, and to
          make us forget the days of our mourning. You alone had power to bestow upon us the
          blessing of his presence, and how shall we acknowledge our obligation to you? Words fail
          us. We can only say that though you know not how great is the favor you have granted for
          we did not expect to have seen his face again on the shores of time. We pray you may be
          abundantly rewarded for this act of mercy: And when you like us stand upon the thresh-hold
          of time may the remembrance of this and similar acts of mercy gild your departing hours.
          May God bless you and keep you through time, and at last receive you to blest mansions
          above. So pray . . . .</p>

        <salute>Dear Marshall:</salute>
        <p>It has been nearly a month since I heard from you. You know that I take an interest in
          your welfare. I hope you will conform to all the regulations of the Academy, and perform
          with alacrity every duty which may be required of you. If you will do this and give
          regular and close attention to your studies, you have talents to enable you to maintain,
          not only a respectable, but a high standing in your class. If you shall fail to maintain
          such a standing, it will be your own fault, and I shall be greatly mortified, at it. You
          should so conduct yourself as to avoid demerit marks, and to be always prepared for your
          recitations. I am frequently called upon to receive the proceedings of Courts Marshall in
          the case of Cadets, and in almost every case, the delinquency is to be traced to culpable
          inattention to duty. It is a painful duty, to confirm the <pb/>sentences against them but
          the discipline of the Institution and the good of the service requires it. You must not
          make the mistaken calculation that because you are my nephew, you can be protected or
          receive any favour. All the Cadets stand on the same footing, and if unfortunately you
          should offend, you must calculate to suffer the punishment which may be awarded in your
          case. I hope that no such case will occur; and I know that you can avoid it, if you
          resolve to perform your whole duty faithfully.</p>
        <p>It is my wish that you should write to me every two weeks. If you have nothing else to
          communicate, you can inform me how your health is, and how you are progressing in your

        <p>There is a good deal of excitement here, about the <hi rend="italics">3 months extra
            pay</hi>. I therefore take leave to add, to what I said yesterday, that “in the

            <hi rend="italics">includes rations</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italics">every thing else</hi>.
          But when the sentance operates upon <hi rend="italics">pay only</hi>, the court adds <hi rend="italics">pay</hi>, <hi rend="italics">proper</hi>. I send this as Amicus Curia
          wishing prosperity to the President &amp; his Administration.</p>

        <salute>My dear Sir/</salute>
        <p>I think it will give you pleasure to hear the opinion expressed by the Earl of Shrewsbury
          of <name type="person">Mr Martin</name>, whom you have recently been pleased to appoint
          Chargé d’Affairs at <name type="place">Rome</name>.</p>
        <p>The Earl by the marriage of his two daughters with the <name type="person">Princes
            Doria</name> &amp; <name type="person">Borghese</name> is connected with the most
          distinguished and influential families in <name type="place">Italy</name>, and he is
          besides as you of course well know, the leading Catholic Peer of <name type="place">England</name>.</p>
        <p>“I wish to tell you,” he says, “that we found <name type="person">Mr Martin</name> a
          <pb/>particularly clever, entertaining, gentlemanly, and high principled person. He was
          just the man to select for <name type="place">Rome</name>; his Catholic prepossessions are
          very strong.”</p>
        <p>From one whose position affords such excellent opportunities of forming a correct
          judgment, this opinion is interesting, and I have therefore taken the liberty of
          transmitting it to you—trusting that you know how dear to me is the praise of all that is
          American.</p>
        <p>I learn from <name type="person">Miss VanNess</name> that <name type="person">Mrs.
            Polk</name> is looking quite well, and that you have quite recovered your health. Will
          you favour me by offering to <name type="person">Mrs. Polk</name> my most kind
          remembrance. My conversations with Genl Armstrong about America are among my great sources
          of happiness.</p>
        <p>I blush to speak to you of this suffering country—we are in fact in a state of
          revolution, and from the reports of today, we seem little short of the state of the
          continent; it is in vain that the government papers turn the Confederations of Ireland
          into ridicule—it is in vain that armies are sent out against them. When the Habeas Corpus
          Act is suspended, in what are Englishmen and Irishmen better off than the serfs of <name type="place">Russia</name>? And an imbecile Administration, a renegade Whig faction,
          sleep on the brink of the volcano, and think that thus they shall govern &amp; triumph! In
          fatal security, in cruel recklessness they have voted coercion—but every honest and clear
          sighted man condemns their course of folly. Meanwhile we have again the potato disease in
          all its severity, but as you are blessed with an unusually early and abundant harvest,
          this is of less <pb/>importance. And the calamity in its ultimate influence may prove a
          blessing for it will utterly destroy the remnant of Protection.</p>

        <salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
        <p>Your letter of the <date when="--06-17">17th of June</date> &amp; its enclosures reached
          me so seasonably, that I was able to reply to <name type="person">Governor Swain</name> on
          the Fourth day of July. I did not fail to make particular search in the archives of this
          Government for all that related to the early movements for liberty in <name type="place">North-Carolina</name>. Governor Sir <name type="person">James Wright</name> of <name type="place">Georgia</name> was the first to send from America a copy of the Mecklenburg
          Resolves; &amp; that copy is still in its place. I had already had a copy made of them,
          &amp; was exalting in the thought of my great discovery, when I found that simultaneously
          with myself <name type="person">Governor Swain</name> had succeeded in finding a copy of
          them in Charleston. So much the better: history gains, though I lose the pleasure of being
          the first to recover for <name type="place">North Carolina</name> a document of such
          surpassing interest in her history. Connected with the Mecklenburg Resolves are two or
          three little passages in letters &amp; journals, of which I will send you copies at some
          future day, if you desire them. The Archives abound also with papers on the Regulators,
          which show those ill-used men to have been pioneers in the valley of the <name type="place">Mississippi</name> &amp; patriots always. After the defeat of the Americans
          under Gates, the Regulators were among the principal resources of the patriot-party in
          rallying anew &amp; recovering the Carolinas under the lead of Greene. And they knew what
          they were about; claiming to be in the regular line of succession <pb/>from the opponents
          to the Stamp Act. Indeed I do not think that the instincts of any state turned more
          directly towards freedom than those of the people of the midland counties of <name type="place">North Carolina</name>, or that any started earlier in the career of
          independence, or pursued that end with more perseverance.</p>
        <p>The ratified treaty with <name type="place">Mexico</name> soon followed your letter. I
          know not what is said of this treaty at home; but an American abroad cannot but see that
          it is one of the greatest events of our time. So it is viewed by British Statesmen; so it
          is regarded by those of our countrymen who stay in <name type="place">Europe</name> long
          enough to form their judgments or indulge their patriotic feelings independent of party
          influences. Every one sees that the Pacific Ocean falls under the peaceful influence of
          our flag: &amp; that it is our civilization which is to make its impression on the islands
          in that immense waste of water and on the opposite continent. <name type="place">Japan
            &amp; China</name> are brought near to the <name type="place">United States</name>:
          &amp; the <name type="place">Sandwich Islands</name> become to us far more valuable than
            <name type="place">Southern Africa</name> ever was or ever will be to <name type="place">England</name>. This country will scarce make a struggle to dispute our supremacy in
          the mighty West; &amp; will find its attention more and more engaged by its domestic
          difficulties. The struggles in <name type="place">Europe</name> are but beginning: &amp;
          will not rest, til every vestige of feudal nobility is effaced; and the power of the
          people shall have superseded that of hereditary princes. That the era of the commencement
          of the great struggle, which will go on for generations, is contemporary with your
          administration, is <pb/>an additional testimony to its merit. I have been, in the short
          period of my residence here, the witness to the great advancement, which the American name
          has in the last three years made in the respect of all Europe &amp; in the affections of
          all lovers of free Government. <name type="place">Switzerland</name> will at once succeed
          in imitating our constitution; France will succeed but not quite so soon; Germany openly
          avows that she takes <name type="place">America</name> for her model in her desire of
          effecting the union of States which desire like our own to preserve also their local &amp;
          separate existence &amp; opportunity of development; and these most expressive tributes to
          our institutions as well as the wish of European industry to emigrate &amp; seek a home
          with us would not be at this time so rapidly on the increase, if there were not the
          conviction that our country is, well administered as well as well constituted. If from
          considering the relation of your administration to the world, you look at home, I can only
          say, what the near approach to its end enables me to say without fear of misconstruction,
          that for fidelity to the democratic principle &amp; the best interests of our country, it
          has never been equaled. The establishment of the constitutional Treasury, the overthrow of
          protection, the adjustment of our boundary, the rigidly strict construction of the
          Constitution, the annexation of <name type="place">Texas</name>, the purchase of <name type="place">New Mexico &amp; California</name> form a series of measures, the like of
          which can hardly ever again be crowded into one administration of four years, &amp; which
          in the eyes of posterity will single yours out among the administrations of the century.
          The state of the country now shows <pb/>your complete success. You have settled every
          great question; and when parties seek to select your successor, no one of the old issues
          is found so far undecided as to kindle zeal or inflame the public mind. How tame is the
          present contest, compared with that of <date when="1844">1844</date>. The public is
          tranquil from apathy in the comparison. And the reason is because you have quieted the
          questions that then agitated the public mind. This is my great source of grief at the
          course of a portion (which in the end as I believe, will be found to be <hi rend="italics">a very small</hi> portion) of the democracy of the North, in its secession. They put at
          hazard the great measures which your administration has perfected, &amp; in which the
          public with unusual unanimity is beginning to acquiesce. The business men of <name type="place">New York</name> at this time dread a change, and enter reluctantly upon the
          struggle. I think as ill of slavery as Mr Van Buren can do, &amp; should deplore any
          measures that would stimulate the increase of the African race within our limits; but I
          cannot see how a party organization, comprising whigs of every hue, men who were loudest
          in denouncing <name type="person">Mr Van Buren</name> eight years ago, can by any
          possibility tend to accomplish that end. The protest of old against slavery, the
          declaration of human equality in our great title-deed of independence, the suppression of
          the Slave trade, the gradually increasing tenderness towards the black, the Ordinance of
            <date when="1787">1787</date>, the acts of Congress containing slavery, all came from
          the judgment of the country, including south and north; and I see no good reason for not
          continuing to abide by that which shall be the enlightened judgment of the collective
          country.</p>
        <p>
                    <pb/>But I have written more than you will have time to read, though I have by no means
          said all that was on my mind in reference to your position before the democratic party
          &amp; the country. Looking on from a distance, I say with you, the democracy can succeed
          even without <name type="place">New York</name>; thanks to the vigor infused into it by an
          administration which with all its personal enemies, has satisfied the judgment &amp; the
          pride &amp; the patriotism of the country. I hope it will succeed.</p>
        <p>
                    <name type="person">Mrs. Bancroft</name> joins me in desiring our affectionate regards to
            <name type="person">Mrs Polk</name> &amp; in sending you our best wishes for your
          happiness.</p>

          <p rend="block">[<abbr>P.S.</abbr>] Pray keep down the administrative expenses. They love us in Europe
            because we spend so little on the army &amp; navy in time of peace. Let us not lose that
            good name. The papers say the House has voted $11.000.000 for the navy alone. The world
            expects of republicanism economy in army &amp; navy expenditures, as a cardinal
            principle.</p>

        <salute>Sir,</salute>
        <p>When I saw you, early in July, you supposed, as I then did, that the unhappy divisions of
          the Democracy in this State, would have the effect to give the Electoral vote to <name type="person">Genl. Taylor</name>—since <name type="person">Genl. Taylor</name>’s letter
          of acceptance and the strange union, at Buffalo, of Whigs, Abolitionists and a large
          portion of the Democracy of this state—(unless ere the <pb/>election, some other mighty
          change comes over the People of the Empire state.) <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Genl. Taylor</name> cannot get the Vote</hi>, and consequently cannot be elected by
          the People. The election may, perhaps, go to the House of Representatives and if so, Gov.
          Cass will, doubtless, be elected.</p>
        <p>I have just seen a very intelligent Gentleman of Connecticut (commissioner of school
          Fund.) who has been spending a few weeks in <name type="place">Northern Ohio</name>, he
          says <name type="person">Genl. Taylor</name> has not the least chance in that section of
            <name type="place">Ohio</name>. In our flourishing Town, he remarked to some Gent., you
          are mostly whigs here. Yes was the reply and he added all go for <name type="person">Taylor</name>, I suppose. The reply was Taylor cannot get 3 votes in Town out of
          several hundred. . . .</p>

        <p>There is nothing of interest, transpiring since you left. I clip the following from the

                        <name type="person">Walker</name>

            York <hi rend="italics">Evening Post</hi>, titled “‘Slave Abduction Case’” and
            attributed by the paper to “A friend.” According to the article, “‘the President of the
              <name type="place">United States</name>, speaking of the abduction, by wholesale, of
            numbers of negro slaves, some time since, makes use of the following language: “Had this
            been to give them freedom, he” (that is, the abductor) “would have done right. But it
            was to consign them,” &amp;c. &amp;c. Are not the doctrines of freedom gaining ground,
            indeed, when the most prominent of southerners, himself the owner of slaves, openly
            acknowledges—and commits to paper—the opinion, that whoever takes away those slaves to
            give them their freedom, does “right”?’” The author promises <pb/>“‘proof’” of the

          should be at Fort Leavenworth, early in September, when I have no doubt you will find the

          remain in the country, as a part of the military force which will be employed there. It is

        <p>I am this morning distressed on your account at the change in the <pb/>weather, fearing
          that you will be discouraged and return home without benefit to yourself. I hope that you
          will not get sick, and know that you will keep a <hi rend="italics">large fire</hi>, and
          wish that you may be able to stay as long as you intended when you left. There is nothing
          to call your attention back here so soon. I saw <name type="person">Mr. Buchanan</name>
          last evening; he was full of the foreign news, but I learned nothing very specific. I did
          not go to church on yesterday. I coughed so much I was afraid of disturbing the
          congregation. I would be very happy to be with you to-day at Bedford. The visit of our
          family circle to <name type="person">Mt. Vernon</name> has passed off very well. The trip
          to <name type="place">New York</name> and <name type="place">Tennessee</name> is still on
          the <hi rend="italics">tapis</hi>, and when they will be accomplished is more than I can
          tell. I heard from you verbally on yesterday morning. I fear that you will be so taken up
          with the Democracy of <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> that you will not find time
          to write me. If it rains to-morrow as it does to-day I will look for you back on
          Wednesday. <hi rend="italics">Not</hi> that I think you ought to come, but knowing you as

        <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
        <p>An effort is being, or soon will be made for the removal of Gen. Gould now Marshall of
          the Northern District of this State. I doubt the propriety of the movement, or to say at
          least, its policy. <hi rend="italics">Quere</hi>, Would it not be better to leave him
          where he is, than to turn him out before election? By the 15th of Novr. we will all know
          who will be <hi rend="italics">President</hi> (if he live). We will also know who during
          the coming contest have been faithful to the <hi rend="italics">Democratic faith</hi>. If
          Gen Gould should not be, as I believe he will not be!, faithful!!, “May his days be few
          &amp; another take his office.” <hi rend="italics">I would like to have it.</hi> We are
          laboring here as best we can for the success of the Baltimore nominees. Strange it is,
          that <name type="person">Mr. V. B</name> should have so soon lost his Southern principles.
          I was at the white house by especial invitation in <date when="1838">1838</date>.</p>
        <p>The Presidint, <name type="person">Mr. Wright</name> &amp; several others besides myself
          were there. The main question discussed was Atherton’s resolutions. I did not believe in
          the propriety or necessity of passing them. The President &amp; <name type="person">Mr.
            Wright</name>, both, asked me what I would do with abolition petitions. I answered, I
          would refer them to the appropriate Committee or Committes.</p>
        <p>If Petitioners ask for the abolishment of Slavery &amp; the Slave trade <pb/>in the
          district of Columbia I would refer to the Committee on that District.</p>
        <p>If petitioners asked for the same in territories of the <abbr>US</abbr>, I would refer it
          to the committee on <hi rend="italics">Territories</hi>. <name type="person">Wright</name>
          said, what the<note place="foot" n="2">Short dashes here and below may represent commas or
            periods; others in this letter have been so rendered.</note> would you say were you on
          either of those Committees? I answered, I would make a very short report. It should be
          something like this—<note place="foot" n="2">Short dashes here and below may represent
            commas or periods; others in this letter have been so rendered.</note>“The committee to
          which has been refered sundry petitions asking for the abolishment of Slavery &amp; the
          Slave trade in the District of Columbia &amp; Territories of the United [States]<note place="foot" n="3">Word inserted to complete probable meaning.</note> Respectfully
          report, that in the judgment of said Committee, it is a matter with which Congress has no
          right to meddle or interfere.” <name type="person">Mr. Van Buren</name> remarked, <hi rend="italics">The South will not be satisfied with any thing short of the resolutions
            of Atherton.</hi> I replied by saying, The South did not seem to be dissatisfied with
          the report of Mr. Pinckney of <abbr>S.C.</abbr> I believe in the <hi rend="italics">right</hi>, of petition. We are the servants, not the masters of the people! The people
          place us where we are. They may at times ask us to do what we cannot do constitutionally.
          If they do so, would it not be better to give them our reasons for rejecting their prayer,
          than to lay petitions on the table without reading, reference, or consideration? It was
          the opinion of a majority of the conclave, that no man could be recognised as a democrat,
          or, a friend to the then administration; who would not go the whole length of the Atherton
          Resolutions. They were passed, no man more anxious for their passage <pb/>than <name type="person">Mr. Van Buren</name>. (apparently) Where is he now? It pains me whenever
          the thought comes over me—I have been one of his supporters! The old world has had its <hi rend="italics">Iscariot</hi> The new its Arnold &amp; Van Buren. I will not mention Burr
          in this category; because, I think him better than the rest. It is impossible to give any
          reliable opinion in regard to the election in this State.</p>
        <p>Many whigs will vote for <name type="person">V. B. Many</name> will stay at home &amp;
          not vote at all. I believe that the Buffalo nomination will rather profit than injure us.
          I dont’ know but the wish may be father to the belief. We shall see whether or not the
          belief be well founded. <name type="person">Mr. Van Buren</name> has been for many years
          the pet of this state. You cannot have forgotten who were his wire pullers in 47–8. Would
            <name type="person">Hoffman</name>, <name type="person">Purdy</name>, <name type="person">Butler</name>, <name type="person">Gillett</name> &amp; lots of others

        <p>
                    <pb/>The undersigned a few of your Democratic friends of Blair County having heard of
          your visit to Bedford Springs, feel anxious, in common with their Democratic Brethren of
          this place, to take by the hand and hold converse with the man who has so fully realized
          the expectations of the friends of Equal rights throughout the Union—and whose
          administration of the Government thus far has clearly illustrated, and largely contributed
          towards the perpetuation of, those sound democratic doctrines as held forth by <name type="person">Jefferson</name>, <name type="person">Jackson</name>, <name type="person">Madison</name> &amp; <name type="person">Monroe</name>.</p>
        <p>We therefore tender you a Cordial invitation to visit this place on your return to the
          Seat of Government. We will be happy to greet you at our mountain homes.</p>

          should be appointed. Since <hi rend="italics">

                    </hi>

          enclose.<note place="foot" n="2">The enclosed clipping from the <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>
            <hi rend="italics">Pennsylvanian</hi> contains a statement signed by <name type="person">John McKeon</name>, <name type="person">O'Conor</name>, <name type="person">Horace Greeley</name>, and five other members of the Directory of the Friends of <name type="place">Ireland</name>. They assert that news brought to <name type="place">New
              York City</name> by the <hi rend="italics">Cambria</hi>, from British “Tory papers, is
            intended to deceive the public, and to depress the cause of <name type="place">Ireland</name>. Collisions have
            occurred, the precise result of which cannot be stated, as the patriotic journals are
            all suppressed. But known events . . . are all eocouraging. The whole Government force has
            been employed for a week in attempts to arrest the leaders without effecting a single
            capture. Those leaders have adopted the most effectual means, and will be successful.”
            The authors call for “prompt and continued action” by “our friends in every part of the
            Union.” <abbr>NjP</abbr>.</note> Though all my sympathies are enlisted on behalf of the

          the <name type="place">U. States</name>, I would be bound to enforce our neutrality laws,
          and should do nothing which would have the appearance of encouraging their violation. If I

          left I would have told him so frankly. I do not know that it should have any influence
          upon my action, but think it proper to enclose it to you, and to inform you of what has
          occurred, that you may be, the better able to advise me on my return.</p>

          been spending a few days at this place for relaxation and the benefit of my health.</p>
        <p>It has given me pain to learn from you, the embarrassments under which you labour in the
          pending political contest in the State, and it would give me still more, if I have
          unconsiously contributed to produce them. Surely I had no such intention and such a
          thought had never occurred to me, until I received your letter. You state in your letter
          “I never wanted office under your administration.” This I had always understood to be your
          true position; and this being so, I am at a loss to conceive, how any of our mutual
          political friends in the State, could come to the conclusion, as you state they have, that
          you had been “strangely <pb/>pretermitted, if not neglected in the distribution of
          honors.” In regard to what illiberal political opponents may say, both you and I have been
          long enough in public life to know how little it should be regarded. They are seldom able
          to inflict any injury, by such means. When I held a conversation with you, at the time I
          was forming my cabinet, I understood your position, and have ever since understood it to
          be as you now state it. You returned to Tennessee not looking to the Federal Government or
          desiring any position however honourable under it, and entered upon the canvass as a
          candidate for Governor in which you were successful. At the end of two years, you were a
          candidate for re-election and none of your friends more sincerely regretted your defeat
          than I did. Up to that time, the whole country saw and knew that you would not have
          accepted any position under the Federal Government if tendered to you. Since that time,
          the tender of a high position, which you state, and I knew, you would have declined to
          accept, could have been of no service, in giving you greater character or political
          standing that you already possessed. With this strong impression on my mind, and in its
          correctness I think I cannot be mistaken, such a tender as you speak of, was not made. You
          and I have been long intimate personal and political friends, and I should be sorely
          distressed if I had done any-thing which could injuriously affect, you in any possible
          way. Upon a calm review of this painful subject, I think you must on reflection be
          satisfied, that you attribute too much consequence to what those who are uninformed on
          <pb/>the subject may say.</p>
        <p>In regard to a connection with a newspaper at Washington, I scarcely thought you serious,
          and it made so little impression on my mind that I had forgotten it, until it was called
          to mind by your letter. It would have been a position, far below your merits and wholly
          incompatable, with your character and the high public stations you had filled.</p>

        <salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>After my long confinement, and arduous duties, at <name type="place">Washington</name>, I
          felt at the close of the late session of Congress, that I required some relaxation from
          business, and resolved to spend a few days at this place. It has so happened that ever
          since the commencement of my administration, some important public question has been
          pending, <pb/>requiring my constant attention, and I have not been absent a month, from
          the seat of Government, during that whole period. The closing days of Congress were of an
          important and highly exciting character. I rejoice that a Territorial Government, has at
          length been provided for Oregon, but deeply regret that the delicate and agitating
          question concerning slavery, could not have been settled by Congress, upon principles of
          conciliation and compromise, and Territorial Governments have been established also, over
          New Mexico and California. In view of the excitement which existed, threatening to array
          the country into geographical parties, which could not fail to destroy the harmony, and
          might prove dangerous to the existence of the Union, I felt it to be my duty, to accompany
          the Announcement of my approval and signature of the Oregon Bill, with the message which
          you have seen. That message, at the same time, that it expresses my well-considered
          convictions, it was hoped would tend to allay the excitement in the different sections of
          the Union. Time will decide whether it will have this effect. I was strongly urged to
          with-hold my sanction from the Oregon Bill. A Southern convention I was informed was
          openly spoken of by members of Congress. I gave my approval to the Bill, and protested
          against such a convention, as calculated to do no possible good, but on the contrary to
          widen the breach between the North and the South, upon a question which I believed and
          still believe, ought to have been, &amp; can yet be, settled by a satisfactory compromise.
          I trust the message may do no <pb/>harm, and hope it may do good. Since its appearance I
          have heard nothing further of the projet of a Southern convention. It cannot I think be
          doubted, that some of the leading men of the Whig party, North and South, preferred to
          have no settlement of the slavery question, at the late session, but desired to keep it an
          open question, with a view to political agitation, calculating upon its effect in the
          Presidential Election. The establishment of a Territorial Government over Oregon, has
          deprived them to that extent, of the wicked use, which they may have designed to make of
          so delicate &amp; dangerous a question.</p>
        <p>I think I may safely congratulate you, upon the almost certain prospect of your election.
          Should the excitement in the South, upon the slavery question be allayed, by the prospect,
          that in organizing Territorial Governments, in <name type="place">New Mexico</name> and
            <name type="place">California</name>, it will ultimately be settled by compromise, I
          think that result is certain. Indeed the present prospect is, that you may receive the
          support of every Southern State, except <name type="place">Kentucky</name>. I need not
          assure you, that I shall be most happy, if, at the close of my term I can surrender the
          Government into your hands. In that event the great principles embodied in the Baltimore
          Resolutions of <date when="1844">1844</date>, and <date when="1848">1848</date>, which I
          have endeavoured faithfully to maintain, will be carried out. Since I have been here I
          have seen several of our leading and best informed political friends, who assure me that
          the defection of the Barnburners in <name type="place">New York</name>, and the
          nominations made at Buffalo, will produce not the slightest effect upon the Democracy of
          this state, <pb/>and that your majority will probably exceed that given to <hi rend="italics">Governor Shunk</hi> at the last state election. My information from
          Tennessee is highly encouraging. <hi rend="italics">Governor Brown</hi> and others have
          taken the stump, are actively canvassing the State, and are confident of success. I shall
          return to Washington on tomorrow, where I shall be pleased to hear from you.</p>

        <salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
        <p>I have concluded to be absent ten or twelve days &amp; will leave in the morning. I have
          learned since you left, that Gov. Bagby wrote a letter in the fall of ’45 &amp; which was
          published in the Mobile Register (which may be found in the department of state) in which
          he says, as a reason for his course on the admission of Texas, that he had been informed
          from three different quarters (Haywood Dix &amp; Blair) that you had pledged yourself to
          adopt the alternative proposed in the amendment of Benton &amp; there can be no doubt of
          the existence of a conspiracy between these three to assail and slander you &amp; make
          capital if possible in the Presidential election. It occurs to me as the best possible
          course to meet such villany, is to stand still &amp; keep <name type="person">Mr.
            R.</name> quiet until the Presidential election is over. They will make themselves <hi rend="italics">voluntary</hi> witnesses in behalf of Blair before that is over, probably
          as soon as <abbr>B. F. B.</abbr> is removed. I could not leave without making this
          communication. I wished also to make an additional suggestion upon the removal of <abbr>B.
            F. B.</abbr> to tender of it to Chancellor <name type="person">Walworth. McK.</name>
          &amp;, the Oconners are too much identified with the movements in behalf of Ireland, to
          fill that office.</p>

        <p>
                    <pb/>On the <date when="1848-08-11">11th Aug 1846</date>, I filed in the patent office 3
          Specifications, For Seperate Inventions. 1st a New method of constructing Boats, to Float
          on the Surface, and which cannot be Sunk in the water an Inch tho the Bottom may be
          riddled as a Seive. This invention depends Upon an Immense Volume of Condenced air forced
          Into Cylenders &amp;c. (this also serves for Life Boats Bridges wharfs &amp;c &amp;c.) 2nd
          a New Method of Generating Steam by which 2/3 of the weight is saved &amp; no danger of
          Fire &amp;c. 3rd A New method of applying Steam so as to Use its entire percussion powr
          and Also the power of the Forge usually impacted in Boilers &amp; which is the cause of
          their Explosions, A further Befferice<note place="foot" n="1">Wheeler may have meant to

        <p>The foregoing I have been Unabe to pattent or to have models made &amp;c owing to my
          Situation in a pecuniary point of View I delayed 2 years in hopes to obtain ample Funds by
          the Settlement of Some Land Business but as yet have been disappointed and wishing much to
          add another bright and Unfading Luminary to this great Era of Improvement, before the
          Close of your Executive term of office I have Made Free to <pb/>transmit you the knowledge
          of the Facts in order by any means to obtain Such Aid as is Nessary I am willing to give
          any gentleman a full Share for the aid required, or as the Congress of the United States,
          has appropriated 100000 Dollars as a premium to him or them who shall attain certain
          maximus in the Steam Improvements, as I am fully aware I have attained the whole I am
          willing to give the whole of this premium Up for $2500. which will be an outfit Sufficient
          to enable me to attend to the whole matter Untill ready for Use &amp; Sale &amp;c.<note place="foot" n="3">Sentence divisions unclear in this paragraph up to this point.</note>
          Remember poor Fulton, &amp; that, as Fulton made so great and powerfull an Improvement
          Yet, as much more, is now made if not 3. times as much tho. Fulton, must always, have the
          honour of the, application &amp;c. I am Constrained to believe that on my Inventions going
          into operation the great Maximum of Steam powr will be attained as Nearly as the Maximum
          of, Electro Galvanic Power is Attained in its application to Telegraphic Dispatch, all of
          which is most respectfully Submitted, to the Consideration &amp; Investigation of your

        <salute>Sir,</salute>
        <p>I have before me a communication from <name type="person">Col. P. H. Bell</name>,
          commanding the force now in service for the protection of the frontier of Texas against
          our neighboring Indians, which informs me that the discharge of those troops had been
          ordered by <name type="person">Genl. Brooke</name>, under instructions from the War
          Department.</p>
        <p>The order of <name type="person">Genl. Brooke</name>, a copy of which has been forwarded
          to me by <name type="person">Col. Bell</name>, directs the discharge of “<name type="person">Lt. Col. Bell</name>’s battallion.” This intelligence has created much
          excitement and alarm among our frontier citizens as the immediate execution of this order
          would leave them wholly unprotected, until such time as their place might be supplied by
          such <pb/>force as the General Government intend to employ for that purpose. Such a
          measure I feel satisfied was never contemplated by the War Department, advised as it is of
          the unsatisfactory state of our Indian relations at this particular juncture. If this
          order be carried out our frontier settlements will recede at once, and the consequence
          will be not only great individual loss and suffering, but an outbreak on the part of the
          Indians who are now only restrained by the strong demonstrations made by our troops upon
          this frontier.</p>
        <p>The order of <name type="person">Genl. Brooke</name>, referred to above, directs, that
          the troops in question be marched to San Antonio, for muster and pay, which furnishes me a
          reason to believe that he refers to the regiment of <name type="person">Col. Hays</name>,
          raised in <date when="1847">1847</date>, and which was ordered to Mexico with the
          exception of one or two companies left under the command of <name type="person">Lieut.
            Col. Bell</name> on this frontier, and not to such companies as have been raised for
          frontier defence under a discretionary authority given to the Executive of Texas by the
          War Department, dated <date when="1848-07-16">July 16th 1847</date>, on file in this
          Office. I am further induced to believe such to have been the intention of <name type="person">Genl. Brooke</name>, as he by the terms of the order many of these troops
          would have to march a distance of from 200 to 400 miles to reach San Antonio for the
          purpose of being mustered out which could be as well done at their respective stations,
          and with far less inconvenience. And whatever may have been the intention of <name type="person">Genl. Brooke</name>, or as expressed by his order, I can see nothing in
          the General order from the War Department to <pb/>justify the implication that these
          troops raised and in service for a special purpose altogether distinct from the War with
          Mexico were to be discharged. These General orders grew out of a change of our relations
          with <name type="place">Mexico</name>, but there being no change in our Indian relations
          their application to these troops seems entirely gratuitous, more especially when this
          application involves the probability of such serious disasters, for in the interval
          between the disbandment of the troops now upon our frontier and the supply of their places
          by others our whole frontier might be desolated. Your early attention is invoked to this
          matter.</p>

        <salute>Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>Two publications, the one written by <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Benjamin
              Tappan</name>
                    </hi> of <name type="place">Ohio</name>, and the other by <hi rend="italics">

                    </hi> made their appearance in
          the <name type="place">New York</name> Evening Post of the <date when="--07-28">28th of
            July</date>, and were re­published in the National Intelligencer of <name type="place">Washington</name>, on the 1st of August last. Printed copies of these publications cut
          from the National Intelligencer are herewith enclosed to you.<note place="foot" n="1">Enclosures not found. <name type="person">Tappan</name>’s letter of <date when="1848-07-21">July 21, 1848</date>, to <hi rend="italics">Evening Post</hi> editor
              <name type="person">William Cullen Bryant</name> and <name type="person">Blair</name>’s letter of <date when="1848-07-07">July 7, 1848</date>, to <name type="person">Tappan</name> were published in the <hi rend="italics">National
              Intelligencer</hi> under the title “A Chapter of Secret History.” <name type="person">Tappan</name> defends his <date when="1845-02">February 1845</date> vote in the
              <abbr>U.S.</abbr> Senate for the joint resolution offering <abbr>U.S.</abbr>
            annexation to the Republic of Texas, despite earlier having rejected a treaty for the
            same purpose. He asserts (1) that he expected the <name type="person">Polk</name>, not
            the <name type="person">John Tyler</name>, administration to act on the resolution; (2)
            that <name type="person">Polk</name> first had suggested the Senate’s amending the
            House-initiated resolution to give the president the option—in lieu of offering Texas
            annexation outright—to appoint a commission to reopen treaty negotiations, a process
            that Sen. <name type="person">Thomas H. Benton</name> had proposed and that <name type="person">Tappan</name> believes would have averted the Mexican War; and (3) that
            Sen. <name type="person">William H. Haywood, <pb/>Jr.</name>, “told me that he <hi rend="italics">was authorized by <name type="person">Mr. Polk</name> to say . . . that
              . . . he . . . would submit the Senate amendment as the sole proposition to Texas</hi>.”
            The Tyler administration did, however, offer annexation outright and <name type="person">Polk</name> reaffirmed that decision. <name type="person">Blair</name> asserts that
            President-Elect <name type="person">Polk</name> gave him, then editor of the <name type="place">Washington</name>
            <hi rend="italics">Globe</hi>, “<hi rend="italics">full assurance that he would appoint
              a commission . . . if passed in conjunction with the House resolution as an
              alternative</hi>” and gave the same “<hi rend="italics">assurance</hi>” to Haywood and
            Sen. <name type="person">John A. Dix</name>. After <name type="person">Polk</name>’s
            inauguration, according to <name type="person">Blair</name>, the president told <name type="person">Dix</name> that “<hi rend="italics">he intended the instant recall of
              the messenger understood to have been dispatched by <name type="person">Mr.
                Tyler</name>, and to revoke his orders given in the last moments of his power, to
              thwart the design of Congress in affording him (<name type="person">Mr. Polk</name>)
              the means of instituting a negotiation with a view of bringing Texas peaceably into
              the Union.</hi>”</note> In <hi rend="italics">

        <salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>Accompanying this, I have addressed a letter to you,<note place="foot" n="1">
                        <name type="person">Polk</name> refers to his other letter to Brown of <date when="1848-09-06">September 6, 1848</date>.</note> to which I request an answer, as
          early as your other engagements will enable you to give it. I have not the slightest
          recollection of ever having held a conversation with either <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Blair</name>
                    </hi> or <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr
              Tappan</name>
                    </hi>, upon the subject of the annexation of <name type="place">Texas</name>. If I did it is certain that I have been wholly misconceived or
          misunderstood. When I arrived in <name type="place">Washington</name> on the <date when="1845-02-13">13th of February 1845</date>, the subject of the annexation of <name type="place">Texas</name> was pending before Congress. The annexation of Texas was one
          of the main issues upon which I had been elected President of the <name type="place">United States</name>. I was anxious that Congress should, at this then Session, pass
          some <pb/>measure for annexation, if Texas would consent. I believed that unless some
          measure of the kind was passed at that session, there was danger that the “golden moment,”
          for securing Texas as a part of our Union might pass, and that fine territory be lost
          forever. My opinions and my anxiety upon the subject were freely and publickly expressed
          in the Hotel where I was, to all who chose to converse with me on the subject. I was as
          you know, much surrounded with company from the day of my arrival in <name type="place">Washington</name>, until the day of my Inauguration. I had no opportunity to examine
          and did not examine, the particular <hi rend="italics">form</hi> of the different
          propositions which were before Congress. I remember to have learned generally in
          conversation with several persons, and I think it likely among others with yourself, that
          there was some difficulty in reconciling the two Houses, or in procuring their concurrence
          upon <hi rend="italics">any one proposition</hi>, though there was believed to be a
          majority of each House in favour of the measure <hi rend="italics">in some form</hi>. I
          remember that I entertained the opinion, and repeatedly expressed the hope, that if the
          measure could not pass in <hi rend="italics">[our]</hi>
                    <note place="foot" n="2">Word may,
            alternately, be “<hi rend="italics">one</hi>.”</note>
                    <hi rend="italics"> form</hi>, it
          was better to pass it, in <hi rend="italics">any form</hi> than not to pass it all. I may
          have said in conversation and probably did, that if the <hi rend="italics">form</hi> of
          annexation by negotiation, through the agency of commissioners should be the one adopted
          by Congress, or if the measure should pass in the alternative, and <hi rend="italics">that
            form</hi> should be selected by the President, that then, the ablest men in the country
          should be appointed the commissioners. But that I ever decided in advance, and before I
          had <pb/>examined and compared the different propositions which were spoken of, in favour
          of that <hi rend="italics">form</hi> in preference to that of the House, or authorized
          such a purpose to be communicated to Senators, is wholly inconceivable under the
          circumstances which existed. If I was so understood I was misunderstood. This is however
          stated in the publications of <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Messrs
            Tappan</name>
                    </hi> and <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Blair</name>
                    </hi>. For
          what purpose and with what motive or object, the statement is made at this late day,
          (three and one half years after the alledged conversations) I will leave others to
          determine. I know how difficult it is to prove a negative. Circumstances however exist in
          this case, which go far to establish the <hi rend="italics">error</hi>, (to use no
          stronger term) of their statement. One of these circumstances is this. The Resolutions for
          the annexation of Texas, were approved by <hi rend="italics">

              Tyler</name>
                    </hi> on the 1st of <date when="1845-03">March 1845</date>. On that or the
          next day <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Calhoun</name>
                    </hi> called on me to
          consult me, in relation to the selection to be made as between the alternative
          propositions, contained in the Resolutions, informing me that <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Tyler</name>
                    </hi> was deliberating on the subject. I have since
          learned that <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Calhoun</name>
                    </hi> reported to <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Tyler</name>
                    </hi>, in Cabinet council, the result
          of his interview with me. It was in substance that I had informed him (<hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Calhoun</name>
                    </hi>) that I had been so much occupied with
          company and other engagements, that I had not had time or opportunity even to read the
          resolutions which had passed Congress, and could therefore give no opinion upon the
          subject; and that until I was inaugurated and had my own Cabinet around me, I could not
          undertake to decide or give an opinion on the subject, and that <pb/>I left it to <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Tyler</name>
                    </hi> to determine for himself, what
          action, if any, he deemed it proper to take on the subject. <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Tyler</name>
                    </hi> made the election of the alternative embraced in
          the House propositions, as they were called, and had despatched a special messenger with
          his decision and instructions to our charge d’ affairs to <name type="place">Texas</name>,
          before he retired from office. On the 6th of March <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Genl. Almonte</name>
                    </hi> the Mexican minister made his communication demanding his
          passports. It was not until the 10th of March, that the subject was considered by me in my
          Cabinet. When it was considered I had before me the Resolutions passed by Congress, the
          election of alternatives made by <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr
            Tyler</name>
                    </hi> and his instructions given to our minister. I had also before me <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Genl. Almonte</name>
                    </hi>’s letter. The whole subject
          was fully discussed &amp; carefully examined in all its bearings. We were unanimously of
          opinion that <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Tyler</name>
                    </hi>’s election of
          alternatives should not be reversed, but should be confirmed. It was so confirmed and with
          my full assent, and accordingly <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr
            Buchanan</name>
                    </hi> addressed a despatch to that effect to the charge d’ affairs.
          During the whole consideration of the subject not an intimation was given by me, of a
          preference for the alternative form by negotiation, or that any such pledge as that now
          attributed to me by <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Messrs Tappan</name>
                    </hi> and
            <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Blair</name>
                    </hi> had been given. Another
          circumstance is this. The Senate continued in Executive Session, until the <date when="--03-19">19th</date> or <date when="--03-20">20th of March</date>, when they
          adjourned. If I had determined to select the alternative of appointing commissioners to
          negotiate, it would have been necessary to nominate these commissioners for confirmation
          to the Senate, before <pb/>their adjournment. No such nomination was made, and therefore
          any Senator must have known, that the alternative of negotiation by the appointment of
          commissioners had not been adopted, and yet there was no complaint from any Senator or
          from any other quarter that I had acted in bad faith or violated any pledge. Another
          circumstance is this. Texas accepted the overture which was made to her, and in my annual
          message of <date when="1845-12">December 1845</date>, all that had been done by <hi rend="italics">President <name type="person">Tyler</name>
                    </hi> and myself, was
          communicated to Congress, with all the correspondence on the subject, which was published.
            <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Messrs Tappan</name>
                    </hi> and <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Blair</name>
                    </hi> were then silent. Texas was shortly afterwards
          admitted into the Union as a State. The Senators referred to by <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Messrs Tappan</name>
                    </hi> &amp; <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Blair</name>
                    </hi> in their publications, made no opposition to her admission, no
          charge or allegation that they had been deceived by pledges as to the <hi rend="italics">form</hi> of affecting her annexation, and they continued long after that time to
          support my administration, including the Declaration and prosecution of the war with <name type="place">Mexico</name>. I might add other facts and cogent circumstances, but it is
          not necessary, and I will not worry you by a recital of them. You had my full confidences,
          I was in habits of confidential conference with you at the time referred to, by <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Messrs Tappan</name>
                    </hi> &amp; <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Blair</name>
                    </hi>, and I would have been as likely to converse
          with you, without the least reserve, as with any man living. Neither Messrs <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Tappan</name>
                    </hi> or <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Blair</name>
                    </hi> possessed my confidence. It may become necessary for
          me to vindicate myself before the public. At all events I desire to be prepared to do so.
          With this aim I have addressed <pb/>the accompanying letter to you. I wish in your answer
          that you should be full, stating all the conversations you held with me on the subject of
          the annexation of Texas, as far as you may remember them, and all you may know or remember
          of any conversation you may have held with <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr.
              Blair</name>
                    </hi>. To vindicate truth and protect myself from misconception or
          misrepresentation, from whatever motive made is all I desire. I will call on <name type="person">Cave Johnson</name> who possessed my full confidence with yourself, to
          make a statement, such as I request from you, of what he may know. The other members of my
          Cabinet, who had my confidence also, and with whom I conferred freely and without reserve,
          from the time I made known to them my intention to invite them to assist me in the
          administration, I shall if I shall deem it necessary, request to make statements of all my
          conversations with them on the subject of the annexation of Texas, both before and after
          my inauguration. But I will not tax your patience longer than to remark, that for obvious
          reasons, I desire that the fact that I have called on you for a statement of any facts in
          your possession or knowledge, may not at present be made public. I will hereafter
          determine whether it will be necessary to make a publication, in vindication of myself or
          not.</p>

        <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
        <p>Among the letters received by me this morning, is one from the Collector &amp; Naval
          officer at Newport <abbr>R.I.</abbr> containing $30 “to aid in the election of Cass &amp;
          Butler.”</p>
        <p>I make from it the following extract “This State will undoubtedly give her electoral
          votes for <name type="person">Taylor</name> &amp; Fillmore. The influence of Banks &amp;
          Factories give immense power to the Algerine party. And the money of the <abbr>U.S.</abbr>
          now being expended in repairing Fort Adams, goes principally to Algerine whigs employed
          there in preference to worthy Democrats, in injury to one party which is done by the
          Engineer in charge.”</p>
        <p>I send you this extract in the hope that it may be in your power to remedy a part of the
          evil complained of.</p>
        <p>As Treasurer of the National Democratic Committee, I am in the daily receipt of letters
          from all parts of the Union, all of which contain money, and the most cheering accounts of
          the prospects of the Democratic party. The best evidence that the people expect to elect
          Cass &amp; Butler is the fact that I have recd. about 600 dollars, within the past 6
          <pb/>weeks, from persons out of this city, &amp; in sums from one dollar up to 30. In
          addition to this I have received upwards of $200 from subscriptions here, exclusive of the
          large Congressional fund.</p>
        <p>The prospects of a glorious democratic triumph were never more cheering than they now
          are.</p>

        <p>I observe a sale of 100,000 Muskets advertised at New York first Wednesday in
          October.</p>
        <p>Believing the sale of Arms contraband according to the Law of Nations: I beg leave most
          respectfully, to suggest, that the arms be rendered into old “Old Iron” by beating, and
          bending, them out of shape.</p>
        <p>After the Seven Years War: France sold all her arms and they were purchased and on their
          way to the Rhine in wagon trains. The celebrated Genl. Vauban repared immediately to <name type="person">Louis XV</name> and represented the impolicy of arming their neighbors by
          disarming themselves, and the trains were stopped the contracts cancelled and the arms
          sent to the difft <pb/>arsenals to be turned into materiel for other purposes. The sale of
          100,000 stand of arms whilst a Revolutionary spirit pervades the world should cause the
          humane statesman to pause and reflect on the consequences. Sell those arms at the North
          and we arm the Free negroes at once to make War on the South. There are thousands of
          turbulent men principally foreigners &amp; late of the army who would fight for plunder no
          matter who. They would War against the <abbr>U.S.</abbr> as readily as against <name type="place">Mexico</name>.</p>
        <p>If this humble effort will stop the sale of the arms it will singularly gratify a
          Phylanthropist.</p>
        <p>In the War of 1812 an officer of the Militia could seize public Arms wherever found and
          the writer has often done that duty with a party of men, but since Arms have been sold by
          the Govt. thousands of arms have been stolen &amp; sold all over the world.</p>
        <p>
                    <name type="place">Great Britain</name> never sells any of her public arms. Nor does
          France. Besides selling 100000 stand of Arms at <name type="place">New York</name> would
          give England just cause to believe the object is to arm <name type="place">Ireland</name>.</p>
        <p>The writer does not consider his name material or he would sign it in full.</p>

            July</date>, and were re-published in the <hi rend="italics">National Intelligencer</hi>

        <p>A few days after my arrival in <name type="place">Washington</name> in <date when="1845-02">February 1845</date>, I invited you to accept a place in my Cabinet.
          After you had intimated a willingness to accept the position tendered to you, I was upon
          terms of confidential and unreserved intercourse with you. That you might be fully
          informed in advance, of my views and the principles on which my administration would be
          conducted, I read to you the Inaugural Address which I had prepared in <name type="place">Tennessee</name>, and which I afterwards delivered to my fellow-citizens on the <date when="1845-03-04">4th of March 1845</date>, and conferred freely with you in relation to
          public affairs. No opinions which I entertained upon any public subject, about which we
          may have conversed, were with-held from you. As it may become proper that I should at some
          future day, notice the publications of <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Messrs

                    </hi>, I desire that you will
          furnish me with a statement, of any opinions, views or acts of mine, relating to the
          subject of the annexation of <name type="place">Texas</name> to the <name type="place">United States</name>, <pb/>both before and after my Inauguration as President, which
          may have come to your knowledge.</p>
        <p>I have not the slightest recollection of ever having held a conversation with either <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Tappan</name>
                    </hi> or <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Blair</name>
                    </hi> on the subject of the annexation of <name type="place">Texas</name>. If I did, it is certain that I was wholly misunderstood. When
          I arrived in <name type="place">Washington</name> on the <date when="1845-02-13">13th of
            February 1845</date>, the subject of the Annexation of Texas was pending before
          Congress. That was one of the main issues, upon which I had been elected President of the
            <name type="place">United States</name>. I was anxious that Congress should at its then
          Session, pass some measure for annexation, if <name type="place">Texas</name> would
          consent. I believed that unless some measure with that object, was passed at that Session,
          there was danger that the “golden moment,” for securing Texas as a part of our Union,
          might pass, and that fine territory be lost forever. My opinions on the subject were
          freely and pub[l]ickly<note place="foot" n="2">Letter inserted to complete probable
            meaning.</note> expressed in the Hotel where I was, to all who chose to converse with me
          on the subject. I was as you know, almost constantly surrounded with company from the day
          of my arrival in <name type="place">Washington</name> until the day of my Inauguration: I
          had no opportunity to examine, and did not examine the particular <hi rend="italics">form</hi> of the different propositions which were before Congress. I learned generally
          in conversations with several persons, and I think it likely among others with yourself,
          that there was some difficulty in reconciling the two Houses of Congress, or in procuring
          their concurrence upon <hi rend="italics">any one proposition</hi>, though there was
          believed to <pb/>be a majority of each House in favour of the measure <hi rend="italics">in some form</hi>. I remember that I entertained and expressed the opinion and the
          hope, that if the measure could not pass in <hi rend="italics">[our]</hi>
                    <note place="foot" n="3">Word may, alternately, be “<hi rend="italics">one</hi>.”</note>
                    <hi rend="italics"> form</hi>, it was better to pass it in <hi rend="italics">any form</hi>,
          than not to pass it at all. I may have said in conversation and probably did, for such was
          my opinion, that if the <hi rend="italics">form</hi> of annexation by negotiation, through
          the agency of commissioners, which as I was informed had been suggested, should be the one
          adopted by Congress, or if the measure should pass in the alterrnative, and that <hi rend="italics">form</hi> should be selected by the President, that then thee ablest men
          in the country should be appointed the commissioners. But that I ever decided in advance,
          and before I had examined and compared the different propositions which were spoken of, in
          favour of the <hi rend="italics">form</hi> by negotiation, in preference to that of the
          House, or authorized such a purpose to be communicated to Senators, is wholly
          inconceivable under the circumstances which existed. If I was so understood by any one
          with whom I may have conversed, I was misunderstood. This however is stated in the
          publications of <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Messrs Tappan</name>
                    </hi> &amp; <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Blair</name>
                    </hi>. For what purpose and with what
          object it is stated at this late day (after the lapse of nearly three and an half
            years[)],<note place="foot" n="4">Closing parenthesis missing.</note> I leave to others
          to determine. I know how difficult it is to prove a negative. Fortunately circumstances
          exist in this case, which go far to establish the error of their statements. One of these
          circumstances is this. The Resolutions for the Annexation of Texas, were approved by <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Tyler</name>
                    </hi> on the <date when="1845-03-01">1st of March 1845</date>. On that or the next day <pb/>
                    <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr. Calhoun</name>
                    </hi> then Secretary of State, called and conversed
          with me, in relation to the election proper to be made, as between the alternative
          propositions embraced in the Resolutions, informing me that <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Tyler</name>
                    </hi> was deliberating on the subject. I have since
          learned that <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Calhoun</name>
                    </hi> reported to <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Tyler</name>
                    </hi> sitting in Cabinet council, the
          result of his interview with me. It was in substance that I had informed him (<hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Calhoun</name>
                    </hi>) that I had been so much
          occupied with company and other engagements, that I had not even read the Resolutions
          which had passed Congress, and could therefore give no opinion upon the subject, and that
          until I had entered upon my duties as President, and had my own Cabinet advisers around
          me, I could not undertake to decide on the subject, and that I left it to <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Tyler</name>
                    </hi> to decide for himself, what
          action, if any, he deeemed it proper to take on the subject. <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Tyler</name>
                    </hi> made the election of the alternative embraced in
          the House propositions, as they were called, and despatched a special messenger, bearing
          his decision and instructions to our charge d’ Affaires to <name type="place">Texas</name>, before he retired from Office. On the <date when="--03-06">6th of
            March</date>
          <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Genl. Almonte</name>
                    </hi> the Mexican Minister made
          his communication, demanding his passports. It was not until the 10th of March that the
          subject was considered and finally decided on by me in my Cabinet. When the subject was
          considered, I had before me the Resolutions of Congress, the election of alternatives
          which had been made by <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Tyler</name>
                    </hi>, and
          his instructions given to our minister. The whole subject was fully examined and carefully
          considered in all its bearings. The confirmation of <pb/>your nomination as Secretary of
          the Navy, was delayed for some days by the Senate, but in anticipation of it I had invited
          you to attend the Cabinet meetings, and my impression is, that you were present on the
          occasion referred to. Your memory will doubtless enable you to determine how this was. The
          Cabinet were unanimously of opinion that <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr
              Tyler</name>’s</hi> election of alternatives should not be reversed, but should be
          confirmed. It was so confirmed and with my full assent and approval, and accordingly <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Buchanan</name>
                    </hi> addressed a despatch to that
          effect to our charge d’ affaires to <name type="place">Texas</name>. During the whole
          consideration of the subject, not an intimation was given by me of a preference for the
          alternative <hi rend="italics">form</hi> of annexation by negotiation, or that I was
          embarrassed by any such pledge as that now attributed to me by <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Messrs Tappan</name>
                    </hi> and <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="place">Blair</name>
                    </hi>. It is impossible that all this could have occurred, if I had
          understood myself as having given any such pledge.</p>
        <p>Another circumstance which goes far to negative the allegation is this. The Senate
          continued in Executive Session until the <date when="--03-19">19th</date> or <date when="--03-20">20th of March</date>, when they adjourned. If I had decided to elect the
          alternative of appointing commissioners to negotiate, it would have beeen necessary to
          nominate these commissioners to the Senate, for the confirmation of that body, before its
          adjournment. No such nomination was made and therefore every Senator and the public, must
          have known that the alternative of negotiation by the appointment of commissioners had not
          been adopted, and yet there was no complaint from any Senator or from <pb/>any other
          quarter, that I had acted in bad faith or violated any pledge.</p>
        <p>Another circumstance is this. Texas accepted the overture which was made to her, and in
          my annual Message of <date when="--12-18">December 1845</date>, I communicated to
          Congress, all that had been done by <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr
            Tyler</name>
                    </hi> and myself, and accompanied my Message with all the correspondence on
          the subject, which was published. <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Messrs
              Tappan</name> and <name type="person">Blair</name>
                    </hi> were then silent. Texas was
          shortly afterwards admitted into the Union as a State. The Senators referred to by <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Messrs Tappan</name> &amp; <name type="person">Blair</name>
                    </hi> made no charge or allegation that they had beeen deceived by
          pledges, as to the <hi rend="italics">form</hi> of affecting her annexation which would be
          adopted. They made no opposition to her admission as a State, and they continued long
          after that time to support my administration, including the declaration and prosecution of
          the war with <name type="place">Mexico</name>.</p>
        <p>I might add other facts and cogent circumstances, but it is unnecessary, and I will not
          worry you, by a recital of them. You had my full confidence at the time referred to, and I
          would have been as likely to converse with you without the least reserve, as with any
          other person. Neither <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Messrs Tappan</name>
                    </hi> or
            <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Blair</name>
                    </hi> possessed my confidence. It may
          become neecessary for me to vindicate myself, before the public. At all events I desire to
          be prepared to do so. Were this the only object I do not know that I should trouble you.
          But a higher motive impels me to vindicate my official course in regard to the annexation
          of Texas. That was an event of the highest National importance, conceived and consummated,
          with pure <pb/>&amp; patriotic motives, and it is due to the truth of history, that the
          action, and the motives of action of the public functionaries entrusted with its
          management should be fully known. With this view I address you this letter. I wish in your
          answer that you should be full, stating all you may remeember of my views, or of any
          conversations you may have held with me on the subject of the annexation of Texas. To
          protect myself from misconception or misrepresentation &amp; to vindicate the truth of
          history is all that I desire. I will request like statements from the other members of the
          Cabinet, of what they may know or remember. I will not use them before the excitement of
          the pending Presidential election has passed, and not then unless, it shall appear to be
          proper and necessary.</p>
        <p>I will add that I was much surprised on seeing the publications of <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Messrs Tappan</name> &amp; <name type="person">Blair</name>
                    </hi>.
          I had not the slightest intimation of an intention to make them, until they appeared in
          the <name type="place">New York</name> Evening Post. I was the more surprised from the
          fact, that <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Blair</name>
                    </hi> had previously
          expressed his approbation of all the leading measures of my administration, which of
          course embraced the first, and among the most important of these measures, the Annexation
          of <name type="place">Texas</name>, which had been consummated by the policy which I had
          pursued. He once expressed this approbation to me, in strong terms, in your presence. As
            <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Blair</name>
                    </hi> had been superceed by <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Ritchie</name>
                    </hi>, in conducting the leading
          Democratic paper at <name type="place">Washington</name>, and as I had reason to believe
          he had been dissatisfied at this circumstance, I regarded the voluntary opinion which he
          expressed, as <pb/>magnanimous, and I was gratified to hear it. It made so deep an
          impression on my mind, that on the same evening, I made a note of it. It may not have
          made so deep an impression on you, and you may not remember it. I will recal to your
          recollection the occasion on which it was made. On the afternoon of the <date when="1846-08-15">15th of August 1846</date>, I took a ride with you in your carriage.
          We drove to <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Blair</name>
                    </hi>’s house, some five
          or six miles in the country. We found him alone, his family being absent from home. He
          received us very cordially and was very friendly. During our stay of an hour he took
          occasion to remark to me, that I had been eminently successful in my administration, and
          that he approved all my leading measures. In speaking of the tariff he entirely approved
          the act which had reecently passed, and said he had been more anxious for its passage than
          some of the members of Congress who had voted for it. He said he had argued with <hi rend="italics">Senator Haywood</hi> and had endeavoured to convince him that he ought to
          vote for it, and that he had dissuaded him from resigning his seat in the Senate. He made
          other remarks which are not material. You will of course remember our ride to his house.
          If you remember his expression of approbation of the measures of my administration, and
          you see no objection to it, I desire that you will state your recollection of it, in your
          answer to this letter.</p>
        <p>I have written so long a letter that I will not trouble you with much that I might say in
          relation to public affairs, but will postpone this to some future period.</p>
        <p>
                    <pb/>I have received your letter in answer to mine enclosing to you a communication from

          <p>
                        <abbr>P.S.</abbr> I might have said much more than I have done, upon the subject of
            Texas annexation, and the reasons which influenced my action upon it. I will only make
            one additional remark. I think the wisdom of the choice of alternatives which was made,
            must long since have been manifest to the whole world. If the other alternative had been
            chosen I think there is abundant evidence to prove that Texas would probably have been
            lost to the Union. If negotiations had been opened by commissioners, much delay would
            necessarily have taken place, giving ample opportunity to <hi rend="italics">Brittish</hi> and <hi rend="italics">French</hi> intrigue to have seriously
            embarrassed, if not defeated annexation. It was not until after I had entered upon my
            duties as President, that I had an opportunity deliberately to consider of the two
            propositions and to decide between them. When I decided I had <hi rend="italics">
                            <name type="person">Mr Tyler</name>’s</hi> instructions and <hi rend="italics">
                            <name type="person">Mr Almonte</name>’s</hi> letter before me, and the dangers of delay by
            protracted negotiations, had that mode been selected, were apparent. I acted upon my own
            best <pb/>judgment, and in conformity with the unanimous advice of my Cabinet, and the
            result has proved that I was right. <abbr>J.K.P.</abbr>

        <p>Understanding that <name type="person">Mr Philip T Tyson</name> of Baltimore is about
          <pb/>proceeding to <name type="place">California</name> with a particular reference to
          mineral explorations I have been requested to express my views as to his
          qualifications.</p>
        <p>I have long known his general reputation as a gentleman well versed in mineralogy geology
          and Chemistry and I have every reason to beleive that his reputation is well founded. I
          have also had some opportunity to observe his practical skill in an important coal field
          that of <name type="person">George</name>’s Creek in Allegany <name type="place">County
            Maryland</name>. This is a portion of one of the richest and most important coal fields
          in the United States, and being called a few years ago to explore it in relation
          especially to its coal &amp; iron and all its capabilities I there found <name type="person">Mr. Tyson</name> and <name type="person">Mr J. H. Alexander</name>
          assiduously occupied in opening the coal &amp; iron of <name type="person">George</name>’s
          Creek. <name type="person">Mr Tyson</name> appeared to be well acquainted with the Geology
          of coal &amp; it is my beleif that should government set on foot any researches for coal
          in <name type="place">California</name>
          <name type="person">Mr Tyson</name> is well entitled to their confidence and should an
          appointment be made in relation to that subject I may be allowed to add that I hope it
          will be conferred on him.</p>

        <salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>I wrote a long letter to you, a few days ago,<note place="foot" n="1">
                        <name type="person">Polk</name> to <name type="person">Bancroft</name>, <date when="1848-09-09">September
              9, 1848</date>.</note> and hope to receive your answer as early as you may find it
          convenient to give it. I was gratified to learn that you had succeeded in finding in the
          Brittish archives, evidence fully confirming, the fact of the Declaration of Independence,
          made by the people of Mecklenburg, and the movements for liberty in that part of <name type="place">North Carolina</name>, as early as <date when="1775-05">May
            1775</date>.<note place="foot" n="2">
                        <name type="person">Bancroft</name> to <name type="person">Polk</name>, <date when="1848-09-05">August 5, 1848</date>.</note> The
          authenticity of these bold and patriotic proceedings, though long since established by
          satisfactory proofs, had still been doubted by some. The fact which you state that
          “Governor <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Sir James Wright</name>
                    </hi> of <name type="place">Georgia</name>, was the first to send from America a copy of the
          Mecklenburg Resolves,” and that this “copy is still in its place,” is a very important
          one. I must request the favour of you, to procure for me a copy of the Resolves, and
          especially a copy of the official communication of the Governor, made to his Government in
          transmitting them. You state that “connected with the Mecklenburg Resolves, are two or
          three little passages, in letters and journals,” of which you will send me copies, if I
          desire them. If it shall not put you to too much inconvenience, to procure them, I shall
          be gratified <pb/>to receive them, and also to receive a synopsis, of the proceedings of
          the “Regulators,” to which you refer. Being myself a native of Mecklenburg, and many of my
          ancestors having taken an active part in these Revolutionary proceedings, Itake a peculiar
          interest in all that relates to them.</p>
        <p>I am much gratified at the assurance you give me, in your letter of the 5th ultimo, of
          the “great advancement which the American name, has in the last three years made in the
          respect of all Europe, and in the affections of all lovers of freee Government.” It has so
          happeneed that during my administration a succession of great and important public
          questions foreign &amp; domestic have arisen, involving high responsibilities, great
          labour and constant anxieety and vigilence. If I have been so fortunate, as to be
          reasonably successful in their management, I can only attribute that success, to an honest
          purpose, a strict adherence to principle which has ever been my guide, and to the
          patriotic support, which I have received from the people. If I can close my
          administration, leaving the country prosperous, the measure of my ambition will be full.
          You are right in your observation, that all the old issues which divided the political
          parties of the country in <date when="1840">1840</date>, and <date when="1844">1844</date>, have been virtually settled. The party opposed to the Democratic policy upon
          these issues, manifest, an unwillingness, further to agitate them, or to resist the
          settlement of them which has been made. The only remaining subject giving rise to any
          considerable excitement and division of opinion is that <pb/>to which you allude in your
          letter and,<note place="foot" n="3">
                        <name type="person">Polk</name> probably meant to
            place “is . . . and,” which he inserted with a caret, after the comma.</note> relates to
          the organization of Governments, in the territories recently acquired from <name type="place">Mexico</name>, and this would be readily settled (and I hope will be during
          my time) were it not for the agitation, of the delicate and distracting question of
          slavery. Much excitement existed in Congress, upon this subject, during the last weeks of
          the late Session. An act was at length passed, providing a Territorial Government for
          Oregon, and I deeply regret that Governments, based on principles of concession and
          compromise on the slavery question, had not also been established over <name type="place">New Mexico</name> and <name type="place">California</name>. Had this been done the
          agitation of the slavery question, so far as practical measures are concerned would have
          ceased. In view of the excitement which existed, threatening to array the country into
          geographical parties, which could not fail to destroy the harmony, and might endanger the
          existence of the Union itself, I felt it to be proper to accompany the announcement of my
          approval and signature of the Oregon Bill, with the Message which you have doubtless seen.
          In that message the reasons for yielding my official sanction were succinctly given. The
          question of difficulty which was involved was not an original one, arising for the first
          time. Had it been, my opinion and my action might have been different. But it was a
          question which had been twice adjusted by my predecessors, upon principles of concession
          and compromise, between the North and the South, once in the case of <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="place">Missouri</name>
                    </hi> and again in the case of <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="place">Texas</name>
                    </hi>, and all sections and all parties, had
          acquiesced in the compromise for more <pb/>than a quarter of a century. It would have been
          a momentous responsibility and one which might have involved the integrity of the Union
          itself, to have disturbed this compromise by an Excutive veto. My message, at the same
          time, that it expresses, my well considered convictions of duty, under the circumstances,
          which existed; it was hoped would tend to allay the excitement in the different sections
          of the Union. I am flattered with the belief, that it has to some extent, at least,
          produced that effect. Before my official action on the Oregon Bill, was known, I was
          strongly urged to with-hold from it my sanction. A Southern convention, I was informed,
          was openly spoken of by Members of Congress. I gave my approval to the Bill, and protested
          against such a convention, as calculated to do no possible good, but on the contrary to
          widen the breach between the North and the South, upon a question which I believed and
          still believe, ought to have been, and can still be, settled by a satisfactory compromise.
          Since the appearance of the message I have heard nothing further of the projet of a
          Southern convention. I have now, reasonable ground to hope, that the question may be
          settled at the next Session of Congress, by extending the <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="place">Missouri</name>
                    </hi> and <hi rend="italics">Texas</hi> compromise line
          West to the Pacific. If this compromise shall not be adopted, the subject may be referred
          to the Judiciary, as was proposed by a Bill passed by the Senate, or some other compromise
          may be agreed upon, which if not entirely satisfactiory to all sections, will be
          acquiesced in by country. When the Presidential election shall be over, I <pb/>have great
          confidence that the question can be adjusted, and from all I learn I think it will be, at
          the next session. It cannot I think be doubted that some of the leading men of the Whig
          party, North and South, preferred to have no settlement of the slavery question at the
          late Session of Congress, but desired to keep it an open issue, with a view to political
          agitation, calculating upon its effect upon the Presidential Election. The establishment
          of a Territorial Government over Oregon has deprived them to that extent of the wicked
          use, which they may have designed to make of so delicate and dangerous a question.</p>
        <p>There is less, excitement, upon the Presidential Election than is usual. There is every
          prospect at present of <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Genl. Cass</name>’s</hi>
          election. Indeed I consider this result as almost certain. The whole contest is between
            <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Genl. Cass</name>
                    </hi> and <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Genl. Taylor</name>
                    </hi>, the regular nominees of their
          respective parties. <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Van-Buren</name>
                    </hi>, it is
          true, is the candidate of the <hi rend="italics">Barnburners</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Abolitionists</hi>, and received their nomination at their convention at <hi rend="italics">Buffalo</hi>, but he stands I think, no possible chance of carrying a
          single Electoral vote, out of <name type="place">New York</name>, and every day diminishes
          his chances of success, even in that State. Three distinct tickets for electors, and
          possibly a fourth (for <hi rend="italics">Clay</hi>) will be run in New York, and a
          plurality will decide the vote of the State. I deplore the great error, which <hi rend="italics">Mr Van-Buren</hi> has committed, in suffering himself to occupy his

          Villanous conduct in removing <name type="person">Mr Butler</name> from Office in
            <abbr>N.Y.</abbr> a Man that has done more to make you President of the

          than any Man who ever filled it—a simple 4th rate Tennessee Lawyer as you are and nothing
          more. Cannot a Man <hi rend="italics">think</hi> for himself in this Free Country without

        <salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>I have received your two letters of the 26th ultimo, and 9th Instant.<note place="foot" n="1">Letters not found.</note> I am glad you approve of my course in removing <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Butler</name>
                    </hi> of New York, from the Office
          which I had conferred upon him early in my administration. In addition to the reasons
          which you state, it was proper upon other grounds. I removed a Whig when I appointed him,
          and in this I acted upon the General principle, that the principal chief subordinate
          officer of the Federal Government should accord in opinion with the chief Magistrate, and
          be ready to cooperate with him, in carrying out the general policy, of his administration.
          When <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Butler</name>
                    </hi> was appointed I had
          every reason to believe, that he would cheerfully do so. In this I have been disappointed.
          He has not only abandoned the political party to which he professed to belong, and
          denounced and opposed the regular nominations of that party, made according to former
          usage, but he has abandoned a pratical political principle also, and united himself to a
          faction whose principle of action seems to be to “rule or ruin.” In his case, also, the
          administration was taunted and almost challenged and defied to remove him. Had he been
          contented to entertain abstract opinions, however erroneous I might have thought them, I
          should have been reluctant to disturb him. In a word his who[le]<note place="foot" n="2">Text here and below cut off side of page.</note> course, and that of his friends and
          new political allies, left me no alternative consistently with a due self-respect, as well
          as the public good. I could have wished <pb/>that his course had been otherwise. I will
          take your advice in regard to <hi rend="italics">Mr [. . .]</hi> and will not remove him.
          There is a great pressure upon me at this moment to make other removals in <name type="place">New York</name> and <name type="place">Massachusetts</name>. I doubt the
          propriety of doing so, and my present impression is, that I will not disturb any man in
          office, unless it be in such excepted cases, when the conduct of the officer shall be so
          obnoxious as to make it proper.</p>
        <p>My opinion of the prospects of your success in the election, expressed to you in my
          letter written at Bedford<note place="foot" n="3">
                        <name type="person">Polk</name> to <name type="person">Cass</name>, <date when="1848-08-24">August 24, 1848</date>.</note>
          remains unchanged. In the South all is looking well, and if you are right in regard to the
          North-Western States the result is certain. <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="place">South
              Carolina</name>
                    </hi> I regard now, as certain for you, as any state in the Union. <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Rhett</name>
                    </hi> called to see me two or three
          days ago &amp; expressed this opinion. He has become warm in the cause and has gone to
          Charleston to address a mass-meeting at that place. <name type="place">Georgia</name> I
          consider perfectly safe. In <name type="place">N. Carolina</name> and <name type="place">Tennessee</name> there will be an active and close contest. In the latter state, the
          ablest men of both parties are in the field, addressing the people in mass meetings. <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Gov. A. V. Brown</name>
                    </hi> is performing, Herculian
          labour. At my last accounts he was addressing the people from day to day, in <name type="place">East Tennessee</name>. The contest in t[. . .] State will be bitter and
          close. From all the information I have I think, the Democracy will ca[rr]y the State,
          though this result cannot be regarded as certain.</p>

        <p>In the memorandum of my private business, which I handed to you before you left <name type="place">Washington</name>, I requested you to superintend on my behalf, the
          valuation of my brick store-house and lot in <name type="place">Columbia</name>, which by

                        <name type="person">Mr Hughes</name>
                    </hi> may select to make the
          valuation o[n] his part, and have informed him that you would select another on my
            part.<note place="foot" n="3">

          I wish t[. . .] business attended to before you leave home on your return to Washington. The
          house is to [. . .] delivered to <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr
            Hughes</name>
                    </hi> at the valuation which may be placed on it, on the 1st of January
          next. If you have not heard from <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr
              Stevenson</name>
                    </hi>, may I ask the favour of you to write to him, and remind him of
          the business.</p>
        <p>
                    <pb/>All appears to be quiet in <name type="place">Washington</name>, there being but few
          strangers in the City, but, notwithstanding this, I do not see that my labours are much
          diminished.</p>
        <p>The prospects are decidedly favourable [. . .] <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Cass</name>’s</hi> election. Indeed judging from present appearances I should
          consider that result cert[ain]. The result of no election however is certain until it has
          taken place, and therefore the Democratic party, should not relent in its exertions. I see
          that the leading men of both parties are actively in the canvass in <name type="place">Tennessee</name>. It would be exceedingly gratifying, if my own state, should give its
          vote to <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Cass</name>
                    </hi> &amp; <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Butler</name>
                    </hi>. It would be an endorsement of the measures of
          my administration, measures which <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Genl.
            Cass</name>
                    </hi> has supported with so much ability and fidelity. I hope the State will
          no longer separate itself from the Republican party, but will unite with them, in the
          election, of an enlightened Statesman, (such as regard Genl. C. to be) who will
          faithfully, carry out, the measures of policy which my administration has maintained.
          Judging from the past history of the parties in the state, the contest will be animated,
          if not violent as the day of election approaches, and the majority small either way. Much
          may be effected by active exertion between this time and the election. I hope the
          Democracy may succeed. What is your opinion of the probable result? You will be able to
          speak with some certainty of your own District after you have canvassed it, which I hope
          you have done before this time.</p>

        <p>I have neglected writing you, tho. I have not neglected your business &amp; it is proper
          that I inform you of the state of things. I had a decree made to day in our Chancery court
          in the matter of the Leech land in the western district precisely in accordance with your
            directions.<note place="foot" n="1">Letter, if any, not found.</note> I wrote to <name type="person">Stevenson</name> some time since that I would aid him in valuing the house

        <p>Little matters of taxes &amp;c I have attended to, &amp; furnished Your mother with what
          money she has wanted $50. I will send the receipts at some convenient time.</p>
        <p>My wifes health has been very bad, it has improved a little. The Doctor says she must
          travel some, &amp; I purpose taking her to Bolivar in a few days, &amp; as I go &amp;
          return make some speaches for Cass &amp; Butler. I <pb/>have made three or four Speaches,
          but I cannot get “happy,” like I did in <date when="1844">1844</date>, tho. I hope I will
          do good service. So soon as I get to Bolivar I leave my family and make a three weeks tour
          speaking.</p>
        <p>So far as I can learn the prospects are favorable for a gain thro. this country. The
          whigs have no organization &amp; no enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>Your friends here are all well. Evan Young comes to town every day, but is so paralized
          he cannot walk, has to be lifted out &amp; into his carriage. I found my son nearly well
          when I got home.</p>
        <p>As a last hope the whigs are trying to make something out of your signing the Oregon
          Bill, but with an antiveto candidate it is “no go.”</p>
        <p>When I can serve you, you will not fail to call upon me.</p>

        <salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>I noticced in some of the <name type="place">New York</name> papers, a day or two since,
          articles in relation to the removal of a person named <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">John Scott</name>
                    </hi> an employee in the <name type="place">New
            York</name> Custom House. I took it for granted that <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr <pb/>Lawrence</name>
                    </hi> must have had some sufficient reason for
          his removal, and still think from his known prudence and circumspection that this must be
          the case. I have however seen no explanation in any of the <name type="place">New
            York</name> papers. On the contrary I find in the “New York Daily Sun” of yesterday, the
          article which I enclose to you herewith.<note place="foot" n="1">Enclosure not found. The
            New York <hi rend="italics">Sun</hi> article, titled “Turning the Tables,” reports that
            Scott led a committee of Democrats from <name type="place">New York</name>’s Old
            Hunker faction of the party in asking Collector <name type="person">Cornelius W.
              Lawrence</name> to fire customs house employees who supported Free Soil party
            presidential nominee <name type="person">Martin Van Buren</name>. The article quotes, in
            full, <name type="person">Lawrence</name>’s subsequent letter of <date when="1848-09-16">September 16, 1848</date>, in which he fires Scott but cites no reason.</note> I
          cannot believe that the statements made in this article constitute the only reasons for
          the removal. I will not prejudge the case, but I must say, that this small affair gives
          me, some concern. I hope you will without delay confer with <name type="person">Mr <hi rend="italics">Lawrence</hi>
                    </name> who I am sure has acted from pure and proper
          motives, and ascertain how the facts are. You will readily perceive that the case standing
          as it does, upon the newspaper accounts of it, is subject to be misunderstood and
          calculated to do great mischief. According to these accounts, if the appo[int]ments<note place="foot" n="2">Letters cut off side of page.</note> of the administration are
          retained in office, and its friends turned out because they complain, or petition for
          their removal, you will readily see the false impression which will be made on the public
          mind. I request that you will give your attention to the subject, and write to me after
          you have seen <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Lawrence</name>

        <salute>Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>I thank you for the information you have given me, of the genealogy of the <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Polk</name>
                    </hi> or <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Pollock</name>
                    </hi> family. As requested in your last note,<note place="foot" n="1">Letters not found. <name type="person">Polk</name>’s diary indicates
            that he received a letter from Winder the day he wrote this reply.</note> I have traced
          the issue of <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">John Polk</name>
                    </hi> the eldest son
          of <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Robert</name> and <name type="person">Magdalen
              Polk</name>
                    </hi>, and return to you herewith the [recording]<note place="foot" n="2">Unless noted otherwise, brackets indicate text uncertain, illegible, or missing due to
            a light or blurred ink transfer.</note> of that branch of the family, which you enclosed
          to me, with the information which you desire.<note place="foot" n="3">Enclosure or
            enclosures not found.</note> You will perceive that I have not given the names of the
          Grand children of <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Ezekiel</name>
                    </hi>, and their
          intermarriages, except those of my own immediate branch of his family, nor of his Great
          Grand children and <pb/>their intermarriag[es]<note place="foot" n="4">Letters cut off
            side of page.</note> and issue. These are very numerous. I possess I believe as accurate
          knowledge [. . .] them as any one man living, and if you desire it, will furnish you with
          their [. . .]s intermarriages and issue. I shall be under [ad]ditional obligations to you,
          if you will [fur]nish me with the “tree and short history [. . .] biography,” which you
          inform me you [. . .] preparing.</p>
        <p>In one of your communications you inform me that a correspondence took place in the
          spring of <date when="1824">1824</date>, between <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Col. William Polk</name>
                    </hi> of <name type="person">Raleigh N. Carolina</name> and
          your father the late <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Genl. William H.
            Winder</name>
                    </hi> of Baltimore. If this correspondence has been preserved I would be
          much gratified to have a copy of it. The synopsis which you give of <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Col. William Polk</name>
                    </hi>’s account of his family, and of
          their participation in the Revolution I know from tradition and the history of the times
          to be correct. The fact which you state in one of your communications that, “<hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Ezekiel</name>
                    </hi> was a member of the Mecklenburg
          convention, which in <date when="1775-05">May 1775</date>, first proclaimed Independence,
          and he commanded [. . .] company of Whig Rangers,” I know also, from the same source, to be
          correct. His original commission as a Captain has been preserved, and I have it now in my
          possessi[on]. I would be pleased to receive from you any additional information, which may
          be in your possession and upon which your [substance] is based.</p>
        <p>It appears from the genealogy of the family, [which] you have furnished, that I descended
          from <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">John</name>
                    </hi> &amp; you from <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">William</name>
                    </hi> who were <pb/>brothers and the
          sons of <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Robert</name>
                    </hi> and <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Magdalen</name>
                    </hi>, and that we are both of the fifth
          generation from <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Robert</name>
                    </hi> and <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Magdalen</name>
                    </hi>. I observe a remarkable
          circumstance in your account. It is that <name type="person">John</name>
          <hi rend="italics">my</hi> ancestor married <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Jane
              Knox</name>
                    </hi> and from that marriage my family sprung, and that <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">William</name> your</hi> ancestor married <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Nancy Knox</name>
                    </hi> and from that marriage your family sprung.
          Both <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">John</name>
                    </hi> &amp; <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">William</name>
                    </hi> married wives named <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Knox</name>
                    </hi>. Did they marry sisters? If so, you and I are more
          nearly related than the degrees of desccent from a common paternal ancestor would
          indicate. I remark further that <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Samuel</name>
                    </hi>
          (my father) married <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Jane Knox</name>
                    </hi>. Have you
          any trace of the <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Knox</name>
                    </hi> family? In
          looking at the coincidence of the names, it has occurred to me that my mother may be of
          the same family of her name who were intermarried four generations before, with <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">John</name>
                    </hi> and <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">William</name>
                    </hi> (sons of <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Robert</name>
                    </hi> and <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Magdalen</name>
                    </hi>)
          and that the two families (the <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Polks</name>
                    </hi>
          and <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Knoxes</name>
                    </hi>) may have removed from
          Carlisle to <name type="place">N. Carolina</name>, at the same time. My mother, now quite
          an aged lady, is still living, and I will hereafter ascertain from her, whether she can
          give any information on this point. I think it probable too that she may be able to give
          more minute and accurate information concerning some of the elder members of the family
          descended from <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">William Polk</name>
                    </hi> of Carlisle
          and their descendants, than I have done. I will take pleasure in furnishing you with any
          additional information which I may be able to obtain.</p>
        <p>I fear My Dear Sir: that I may impose such labour upon you by the request I m[ake]<note place="foot" n="5">Letter or letters here and below cut off side of page.</note> but I
          know of no source from wh[om] I can derive so <pb/>much and such reliable information
          concerning our family as from yourself. I desire to embody and preserve all the
          information concerning the family which I can procure. It may be interesting to those of
          our family who may come after us. After you shall have completed the “<hi rend="italics">Tree and History</hi>” which you are preparing I would be pleased to se[e] and converse
          with you on the subject.</p>

        <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
        <p>Your letter of yesterday is this moment received and in reply I inclose you the
          proceedings under which <name type="person">Mr Lawrence</name> removed <name type="person">Mr. Scott</name>.<note place="foot" n="1">The enclosure has not been found, but <name type="person">Polk</name> had received a copy of the resolutions of the <date when="1848-09-12">September 12, 1848</date>, meeting of <name type="place">New
              York</name> City’s First Ward <name type="person">Cass</name> and <name type="person">Butler</name> Association—likely the same document that Walker enclosed herein—on

              1848</date>. Besides endorsing nominees for governor and lieutenant governor, those
            resolutions call on <name type="person">Polk</name> and Collector <name type="person">Lawrence</name> to remove all customs house employees who oppose Democratic
            presidential nominee <name type="person">Lewis Cass</name>’s election, particularly
            Free Soilers. The association, led by president and lead signer Scott, would view <name type="place">Lawrence</name>’s placing this “responsibility in any other quarter, as
            such an evidence of insincerity and imbecility as would disqualify him for the further
            occupancy of the place he himself now holds.” The resolutions accuse some customs house
            employees of “using the wages of Government in their diabolical attempts to destroy the
            Union” and warn of “a civil war between the North and the South.” <abbr>PD</abbr> and
              <abbr>ALS. DLC–JKP</abbr>.</note> You will see that <name type="person">Mr
            Scott</name> not only presided at a meeting charging <name type="person">Mr
            Lawrence</name> with “imbecility and insincerity” but sent him the <pb/>resolutions in a
          letter. For this <name type="person">Mr Lawrence</name> removd him during my absence at
          Boston &amp; the best men of the Cass party approve the act. <name type="person">Mr
            Lawrence</name> was very friendly to <name type="person">Mr Scott</name> having
          appointed him to office some twelve months since. <name type="person">Mr Scott</name> it
          seems instead of being grateful to <name type="person">Mr Lawrence</name> has been <hi rend="italics">in the habit</hi> of abusing him for some past &amp; finally signed and
          communicated the proceedings now inclosed.</p>
        <p>There are some hundreds of applicants now for office in the Custom House who are exerting
          themselves for successing removals. <name type="person">Mr Lawrence</name> has expressed
          not only his willingness but also his determination to remove any violent partizan opposed
          to Cass &amp; especially any one who spoke disrespectfully of you for he is your warm
          personal as well as political friend &amp; always ardently sustains you &amp; your
          measures. He is an open &amp; decided supporter of <name type="person">Cass</name> &amp;
            <name type="person">Butler</name> giving his reasons on all proper occasions. He has
          great weight in the community &amp; he uses all his influence in a moderate judicious
          manner in aid of our cause.</p>
        <p>In this state I fear <name type="person">Taylor</name> must succeed but I have some hopes
          of Connecticut &amp; I think <name type="place">Maine</name> &amp; <name type="place">N.
            Hampshire</name> are certain.</p>
        <p>In <name type="place">N. Jersey</name> I think the chances are greatly in our favor. My
          news also from <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> is good, altho the alliance between
          the Whigs and Natives is complete. That which injures <name type="person">Genl Cass</name>
          most in the Northern cities is the report meet industriously circulated by the Whigs that
          Genl Cass is a <hi rend="italics">war man</hi> &amp; that if elected we shall have a war
          with <name type="place">England</name>. No <pb/>trouble or money have been spared to
          circulate this report. I have met &amp; contadicted it every where &amp; I hope to some
          extent with success. I am as a general rule for peace whenever it can be maintained with
          honor &amp; Especially with our best customer Great Britain &amp; have put this sentiment
          in my reply to a dinner invitation here.</p>
        <p>Since it was published, I have conversed with many on this topic &amp; assured them that
          I entertained no doubt Genl Cass concurred with me in opinion. My letter on this point
          will I trust do some good.</p>
        <p>On Monday I expect to leave for Washington.</p>
        <p>Yesterday I felt called on to direct the removal of <name type="person">Mr. Grout</name>
          a clerk in the Naval office who signed certain proceedings denouncing &amp; vilifying you.
          It seemed to me so clear a case, that I acted without troubling you. In all similar cases
          I shall do the same thing.</p>
        <p>I wish you would think over the propriety of recommending in your next message a Branch
          mint at <name type="place">San Francisco</name> in <name type="place">California</name>—not so much for the gold there, but for the bullion of [Nations]<note place="foot" n="2">Word may, alternately, be “Northern.”</note>
          <name type="place">Mexico</name> Peru and all the West coast of America. The charge for
          coinage in these countries is exorbitant—whereas we charge nothing &amp; would get the
          bullion—also much foreign coin for recoinage. With such a Branch mint we can deprive
          England of her monopoly of this specie especially with the aid of first rate steam ships
          &amp; a route across the Isthmus. <name type="place">N. York</name> capital is <hi rend="italics">now ready</hi> to make a rail road across the Isthmus.</p>
        <p>Your next message being a valedictory will have great weight with <pb/>congress &amp; the
          country.</p>

        <salute>Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>I have received your letter of the 9th Instant, and am satisfied with the account you
          give me of my business. I have not written to you for <pb/>three or four months past,
          because I had no specific directions to give, concerning my business. I desire that you
          will continue to write to me, once every month. I wish you to forward my cotton to <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="org">Pickett Perkins &amp; Co</name>
                    </hi> of <name type="place">New Orleans</name> as you did last year. As you make the bales, send me
          their weights and numbers. I have not yet sold my last year’s crop, [. . .]<note place="foot" n="1">Word illegible, light and blurred ink transfer.</note> I suppose the
          hands are becoming impatient to receive the price of the <hi rend="italics">four bags</hi>
          which belong to them, and which were shipped with my cotton. If they will be better
          satisfied, you can at the end of the present picking season, sell the part wh[ich]<note place="foot" n="2">Text here and below either absent or cut off side of page.</note> you
          may intrust for <hi rend="italics">them</hi> at Granada, and pay to them the proceeds. If
          you conclude to [do] this, you can sell also <hi rend="italics">four bags</hi> for their
          benef[it] for last year, out of those which were shipped to <name type="place">New
            Orleans</name>. If instead of this, they prefer to wait until the cotton is sol[d] I
          will send you the money for them, [as] soon as it is sold. I wrote to <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Leigh</name>
                    </hi> some time ago, and suppose he has engaged

        <salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>I have received your letter of yesterday, in answer to mine of the 20th Inst. I am
          satisfied with the explanation given of the transaction about which I wrote to you. I
          approve of the removal of the clerk in the Naval office. The course stated by you, was
          amply sufficient to justify it. In all cases of like—partisan evidence in opposition to
          the administration—removals should be made. I have great confidence in <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Lawrence</name>
                    </hi>, and have no doubt he will discreetly and
          properly exercise his authority, in such cases as may require it. I suggest to you, that
          you have a conversation with him on the subject, before you leave New York.</p>

        <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
        <p>I have been, for eighteen months, collecting materials for a history of your
          administration, and, after you retire, shall be very glad to receive from you any
          documents which will shed light upon it, unknown to the public. I consider that it will
          constitute a bright epoch in our national annals, not surpassed, if equalled, by any of
          its predecessors. My motive <pb/>is one of grateful recollections, and partly selfish,
          wishing to identify my own name with the history of this brilliant period of our country’s
          progress and glory, so far as an humble historian can thus be identified with the events
          he records.</p>
        <p>Every day confirms me in the regret, that you were committed to decline a second
          election. You would have been re-elected with certainty, and the good old democratic party
          preserved intact.</p>
        <p>While I do not permit myself to indulge in any attacks on General Cass, I support <name type="person">General Taylor</name>, and think him more to be relied on as the guardian
          of the equal rights of the North, and of all the states, than either of his competitors.
          His stability and firmness of character will always render him invulnerable to any
          sectional or anti-republican tendencies. I am grateful to General Cass for supporting the
          war measures of the administration, but am rather more grateful to <name type="person">General Taylor</name> for fighting the battles which necessarily add to the lustre of
          the administration. Besides, I know the temporarising instability of the one, especially
          on the questions connected with slavery, and equally well know the unchangeable principles
          of the other in regard to these questions. I support <name type="person">General
            Taylor</name> on republican grounds, and have no apprehensions of his departure from the
          policy of <name type="person">Mr. Jefferson</name>. Some of the democratic leaders have, I
          think, committed a great mistake in letting General Taylor, even partially, become
          identified with the other party. In this I may prove myself to be mistaken. If I do, I
          shall retrace my steps, <pb/>and be as ready to atone for the error as any friend could
          desire.</p>
        <p>A good deal is said here about my removal from office. It has given me no uneasiness. In
          the first place, as you are not specially and personally interested in the election, and
          would have nothing to gain by any removals not demanded by the public interest, and must
          desire to terminate your presidency in peace and tranquillity, I have not supposed that
          you would act in the premises merely to gratify a gentleman to whom, certainly, I am, in
          no sense, indebted for my appointment. In the next place, I have thought that if a removal
          were to be made, you would let General Cass himself, if elected, take the responsibility.
          And, in the third place, I have known, that on the least intimation from you, I stood and
          still am ready to resign, and to spare you the pain, which I am sure you will feel, if
          making the removal.</p>
        <p>Your namesake, “the last of <hi rend="italics">our</hi> Mohicans,” is remarkably well,
          and is an improvement on all his predecessors. He is three years old, and looks like a
          statesman!</p>

        <salute>Dear Marshall:</salute>
        <p>I have received through the Engineer Department, the “conduct Report,” in your case, for
          the last month,<note place="foot" n="1">Report and any accompanying letter from the War
            Department’s Engineer Department, probably by <name type="person">Joseph G.
              Totten</name>, not found.</note> and am glad to perceive that the number of your <hi rend="italics">Demerit</hi> marks, has been reduced <date from="--07-12" to="--08-03">from 12. in July to 3. in August</date>. This is certainly a commendable improvement,
          and I hope soon to find no <hi rend="italics">Demerit</hi> in “conduct” charged against
          you. I am happy to find that your cousin <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Cadet L.
              Marshall Walker</name>
                    </hi> had no <hi rend="italics">Demerit</hi> mark for August.
          Can you not do as well?</p>
        <p>I observe on examining the last annual Report of the “conduct Roll,” that there were <hi rend="italics">Nine</hi> cadets who had not a single <hi rend="italics">Demerit</hi>
          charged against them during the whole year. Eight of these stood very high in their
          studies in their respective classes, and the ninth held a respectable rank. These facts
          justify the remark, that as a general rule, those cadets who are regular in their conduct
          and avoid <hi rend="italics">Demerit</hi> marks, are more attentive to their studies and
          stand highest in their classes. I do not make these remarks in the spirit of complaint,
          but to impress upon you the great importance of regularity in all your conduct, and of
          close application to all your studies and duties.</p>
        <p>You are now approaching manhood. Th[e]<note place="foot" n="2">Letter or letters here and
            below cut off side of page.</note> present is a most important period of you[r] life,
          and much will depend upon the mann[er] in which you may improve the great advantages you
          possess at the Military Academy, what your future standing as an officer of the army,
          <pb/>should you continue in military service, may be. Should you pass through your course
          at the Academy, with reputation and afterwards desire to resign and engage in civil
          pursuits, the profitable improvement of your time, will be equally important to you. You
          should remember that no other opportunity, for acquiring the knowledge which you may now
          obtain, will ever occur, and that if neglected, the loss can never be repaired.</p>
        <p>I shall look with anxieety for the Report of your standing in <hi rend="italics">studies</hi> in your class, at the January examination, and hope it may be a favourable
          one.</p>
        <p>Tell your cousin <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Cadet L. M. Walker</name>
                    </hi>,

          President of the United States, I addressed a letter to you, and invited you to accept a
          place in my cabinet. You signified your willingness to accept the position tendered to
          you, and arrived in <name type="place">Washington</name> on the <date when="1848-03-05">5th of March 1845</date>, (the day after my Inauguration) and on that day I nominated
          you to the Senate, as Secretary of War, and your nomination was confirmed by that body. I
          was from that period upon terms of confidential and unreserved intercourse with you. No
          opinions which I entertained upon any public subject, upon which we may have conversed
          were with-held from you. The subject of the annexation of <name type="place">Texas</name>
          to the <name type="place">United States</name>, in pursuance of a Joint Resolution which
          had been passed by Congress, at the preceeding session, was one of the first which was

          that nothing I have ever said or done on the subject should be concealed from the public.
          The Annexation of Texas was a measure of the highest national importance, conceived and
          consummated with pure and patriotic motives, and it may become proper, and especially
          after the publications referred to, that the opinions, views and action, of all the public
          functionaries, interested at any stage of its progress, with its management should be

        <p>But what I aske of you now My dear Sir is this, Take no action on this appointment untill
          you see or hear from me. I have been cheated and Scandled by them untill I am half mad
          without a friend to stand by me. Englishmen will support Englishmen even in Normandy. A
          Democrat rates below a negro. Our [Capts]<note place="foot" n="2">Word here and below

        <p>I will write you by next Steamer. In the mean time my dear friend dont [transfix] me to

        <salute>Dear Sir!</salute>
        <p>We reached <name type="place">Columbia</name> two days ago, after a long and disagreeable
          trip, rendered so by the low stage of water in the Ohio River. Our reception was warm and
          pleasant, and so far Mary seems highly pleased and contented “with the wilds of the
            West.[”]<note place="foot" n="2">Closing quotation mark missing.</note> Mother has
          changed but very little in the last year, indeed I think she looks better than when I made
          her a visit last year. The political prospects in Tennessee are more flattering than I
          anticipated, the Democrats seem confident—say they have the state thoroughly organized,
          and rely with great hope on the lethargy and inactivity of the Whigs. My impression,
          however, is that sufficient excitement, does not exist, nor is sufficient interest felt by
          either party to prevent the election from going by default—it is all chance—it is as
          doubtful as the cast of the dice. The feelings of the people are not enlisted—they cannot,
          as in former days, be induced to swarm in crowds to hear discussions—their striking
          indifference is calculated to chill the leaders of both parties.</p>
        <p>I will probably remain in Columbia until after the Presidential <pb/>election—I think of
          entering the canvass—will make probably a few speeches in the lower counties of this
          district to identify myself with the contest.</p>
        <p>I notice that <name type="person">Mr Martin</name>
          <hi rend="italics">Chargé d’Affaires</hi> at Rome has recently died. Who will succeed him?
          I cannot entertain a desire myself, being shut out by propriety, but would suggest, if
          agreeable to your feelings, that something might be gained hereafter by the appointment of
          Lewis Cass jr—if I am infringing the rules of propriety by even making such suggestion you
          will please pardon me, for the future is so dark to me, that I am glad to snatch at any
          light to dispel its gloom.</p>
        <p>Make my best respects to <name type="person">Sister Sally</name>, and assure her that I
          remember her many acts of kindness with sincere gratitude.</p>

        <salute>Most excellent Sir,</salute>
        <p>Although some considerable time has elapsed since my last communication,<note place="foot" n="1">
                        <name type="person">Lane</name> to <name type="person">Polk</name>,
              <date when="1848-08-03">August 3, 1847</date>.</note> still, believe me, my thoughts
          have not been far away <pb/>from my heart felt desires for your health and happiness; and
          that God would grant you his protecting care, and wisdom to discharge your arduous duties
            <hi rend="italics">to the end</hi>, satisfactorily to himself, and hence, for the best
          interest of our common country. And I will take occasion here to remark, that after
          carefully watching and criticising every inch of your administration, I have seen nothing
          whereof to object; unless perhaps, the late Oregon Bill. Had I been in your place, I think
          I should have vetoed that; but still I am not so clear that I should have acted more
          wisely, all circumstances considered, than yourself in signing it.</p>
        <p>In the little pamphlet “a comparison of slavery with abolition,” a copy of which I sent
          you, the rights of the South I think are fairly vindicated; and the only means of
          maintaining them clearly and distinctly pointed out.<note place="foot" n="2">Enclosure or
            separate mailing not found. Lane refers to a pamphlet that he wrote, like this letter,
            under the pseudonym “Amor Patriæ”: <hi rend="italics">A Comparison of Slavery with
              Abolitionism; Together with Reflections Deduced from the Premises, Touching the
              Several Interests of the <name type="place">United States</name>
                        </hi> (<name type="place">New York</name>, <date when="1848">1848</date>). Composed as a letter to
              <name type="person">Lyman Beecher</name>, the antislavery president of Lane
            Theological Seminary, <name type="person">Walnut Hills</name>, <name type="place">Ohio</name>, the pamphlet quotes the Bible to establish God’s approval of slavery and
            asserts that the institution benefits not only Southern slaveholders but also Northern
            manufacturers and slaves themselves. Alluding to the Wilmot Proviso, Lane warns that the
            discussion of abolition in Congress may cause “blood [to] be shed” there and “through
            the length and breadth of the land.” He predicts that Southern members of Congress will
            demand a constitutional amendment (1) increasing slave states’ congressional
            representation by counting their full enslaved populations; (2) defining interference
            “with the domestic concerns of any other State, and especially with the institution of
              <hi rend="italics">Slavery,</hi>” as “<hi rend="italics">treason</hi>”; and (3)
            “guarantee[ing] to the South the peaceable possession of their property” by providing
            federal reimbursement for unreturned fugitive slaves. The amendment’s failure, according
            to Lane, would lead to the secession of every state outside of New England.</note> As
          soon as the Presidential election is over I hope they will organise, carefully examine
          their rights, and cooly determine to maintain them <hi rend="italics">at all hazards</hi>.
          Not another moment is to be lost; and if they will unite to a man and go energetically to
          work and persevere to the end, they will get every amendment to the Constitution pointed
          out in the little pamphlet; and moreover, secure their share of the newly acquired
          territory. But if they will postpone and postpone, waiting for a more favorable
          opportunity, all is lost; and themselves and their posterity enslaved to the north, <hi rend="italics">“whose tender mercies are cruelty</hi>!” Onward is the word. The little
          pamphlet, before alluded to, cost me a great deal of labour to collect the authority and
          condense it in its present form, and <pb/>still making it lucid and conclusive. As soon as
          they were published I ordered three hundred sent to Congress for the use of each house,
          where they arrived about a week before the adjournment, and if I am correctly informed,
          created quite a sensation. Indeed I never knew any thing of the kind to receive so many
          extravagant compliments, and it is quite amusing to hear them gessing at the author. All
          agree however, that it is one of the best things they ever saw, and <hi rend="italics">unanswerable</hi>; and ought to be put into every house in the United States—<hi rend="italics">that the people want light upon this all important subject</hi>; and here
          they have it in a shape they can comprehend; and once in possession there would be no
          danger of a dissolution of the Union nor a violation of the rights of the South; on the
          contrary, there would be peace quietness and brotherly affection the whole length and
          breadth of the country. But as it is, they never hear but one side of the subject, and
          that from designing demagogues and political priests, and hence it need not be wondered at
          if they are led blindfolded to their own destruction and that of their country. If they
          are ever furnished with the necessary light it will be by <hi rend="italics">Congress</hi>; and that they could not dispose of the peoples money more to their
          advantage than to appropriate a sufficient amount to put one of the little pamphlets into
          every house, and much more in accordance with their duty than taking their money to buy
          books for themselves. These remarks and the like of these I have heard repeated over and
          over, and I fully concur.</p>
        <p>Now allow me to ask, would it not be a good thing to mention in <pb/>your next annual
          message, and especially as it will be your valedictory, <hi rend="italics">this great
            subject</hi>, that it is dividing our country, and growing stronger and stronger every
          year, and must, if not arrested, sooner or later, deluge it in fraternal blood? and then
          speak of the little pamphlet as you think its merits require and recommend Congress to
          order a sufficient number to put one into the hands of every voter in the
          <abbr>US</abbr>.</p>
        <p>I ordered but a thousand copies published, five hundred of these I have given away
          including those sent to Congress and I have allowed the publisher to sell the remainder at
          not less than ten cents a copy. But I think they could furnish to Congress by the quantity
          at not over 6 1/4 cents a small amount to bestow upon each voter out of his own money, and
          that too when there is so much at stake.</p>
        <p>I have authorised my friend <name type="person">A. Lane Esq.</name>, at the Tontine New
          Haven, Ct. to make any arrangement in relation to them he may think proper. And through
          him I should be very hapy to receive a line from you if you feel inclined to write.</p>
        <p>This Van Buren abolition party flatter themselves that they are agoing to carry every
          thing by storm; but instead of injuring the South, and the Democratic party as the Whigs
          were in hopes of, the probability is they will destroy the latter and secure the election
          of <name type="person">Mr. Cass</name>. The Whigs are exceedingly troubled just now! But
          should they after defeat go over to the Buffalo party, as some suppose, and form a great
          Northern party against the south, there is no knowing what the consequences may <pb/>be.
          Give the people light, and they have in a nutshel in the little pamphlet, and there is no
          danger.</p>

                    <pb/>My Dear Sir,</salute>
        <p>I understand from a letter received from <name type="person">Majr Lally</name>, that he
          is anxious to get the appointment of Commissioner to survey &amp; mark the Boundary line
          between the <name type="place">United States</name> &amp; <name type="place">mexico</name>. I have no doubt of his entire qualification for the proper discharge of
          the duties incumbent upon the appointment he desires. He is gallant, chivalrous, &amp;
          brave, with intelligence and honor—&amp; devoted to his friends &amp; thoroughly
          Democratic in every impulse of the <hi rend="italics">heart</hi>.</p>
        <p>He is among those who <hi rend="italics">never faulter</hi>, and I love him for the <hi rend="italics">virtues</hi> which enoble his heart.</p>
        <p>You know the manner in which he sustained himself under the most trying circumstances in
          the army. He is <hi rend="italics">in all things</hi> the very man for that place, and I
          need not say how much I would be pleased to see his wishes gratified. I hope you will
          pardon the warmpth with which I express myself. He deserves all I have said &amp; more
          too.</p>
        <p>I beg to call your attention to the merit &amp; worth of <name type="person">Capt
            Bernard</name> of the city of <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>, who so greatly
          distinguished himself as an officer of the Voltigeur Regt in storming Chapultepec.</p>
        <p>It was he, who so gallantly seized the <hi rend="italics">Flag</hi> of that Regt, after
          the second or third Standard Bearer was cut down, scaled the wall in the face of a deadly
          fire &amp; lead forward the assault to the very door of the castle. This fact, &amp; his
          distinguished gallantry appear in all the official Reports. Such officers should be known
          to the Govt. &amp; while it is under <pb/>your direction, I am sure they will be <hi rend="italics">cared for</hi>.</p>
        <p>I should be exceedingly gratified to have him provided for.</p>
        <p>Your Brother <name type="person">William</name> &amp; his Lady, <name type="person">Squire Walker</name> &amp; his family with <name type="person">Picket</name> &amp; Lady
          all spent the day with me. Your mother is in good health. I was anxious for her to have
          come out also, but she would not do so. She was delighted with her Cameo Likeness of
          yourself.</p>
        <p>When you visit <name type="place">Tennessee</name>, or more properly when you come home
          in the spring; I hope you will bring <name type="person">Mrs Polk</name> to my house and
          make it <hi rend="italics">head Quarters</hi> until your House is ready for you. <name type="person">Mrs Pillow</name> joins me in tendering you the hospitalities of Clifton,
          with assurances of the pleasure your acceptance of our invitation will afford us.</p>
        <p>I shall start south in 2 weeks to look after my planting interest. I found my business
          greatly neglected &amp; expect my southern interest has suffered still more from my long
          absence in <name type="place">Mexico</name>.</p>
        <p>I am &amp; have been all the summer; suffering much from the affects of my last wound. I
          have been compelled to decline an active participation in the Campaign now waxing hot in
            <name type="place">Tennessee</name>, because of my very crippled condition.</p>
        <p>Both parties are sanguine of carrying <name type="place">Tennessee</name>. My opinion is
          that the state will vote for Cass, but the contest will be close. I regret the necessity
          of leaving before the election, but it is now 3 years since I visited my plantation &amp;
          having to make arrangements for the removal of my hands I feel that I am obliged to go, or
          suffer greatly in an interest all <pb/>ready greatly neglected.</p>

        <p>I recd yours of the 18h of September inviting my attention to the letters of <name type="person">Messrs. Blair</name> &amp; <name type="person">Tappan</name> published in
          the <name type="place">N York</name> Evening Post of the <date when="--07-28">28h of

          confidential conversations in or out of the cabinet and any thing within my knowledge in
          relation to the matters set forth in those letters.</p>
        <p>In reply I have the honor to state, that for some years before my selection as a member
          of your cabinet as well as afterwards we were upon terms of the utmost intimacy and our

        <p>The <name type="place">Texas</name> question, which had been made so prominent in your

          in Washington as the President elect; and particularly so, after the Report of the
          committee of the Senate, recomending a rejection of the Resolutions which had passed the
          House of Representatives and a postponement of the whole subject; and after the
          introduction of <name type="person">Colo. Bentons Bill</name> in the Senate, proposing the
          admission of Texas or a part of it as a state, so soon as the terms &amp; conditions of
          such admission should be agreed upon between the two Governments. I was at the time a
          member of the House, had voted for the Resolutions of the House &amp; felt the deepest
          interest for the success of the measure. The merits of the two propositions were freely
          discussed among the members in private circles &amp; others at the seat of Government.
          They were treated as antigonist measures—and strong doubts entertained whether either
          could pass both Houses. It was frequently urged by those favoring the proposition of <name type="person">Col Benton</name>, that under it, commissioners would be appointed,
          composed of the most distinguished citizens of the country taken from each of the great
          parties and that the terms, could be thus better &amp; more satisfactorily adjusted than
          in any other way. The names of distinguished citizens were mentioned as the most suitable
          to compose the commission. During the pendency of these propositions, you conversd with me
          freely in relation to them and expressed great anxiety for the <pb/>adoption of some
          measure before the adjournment of Congress. You urged that one or the other or indeed any
          measure should be taken, which would secure annexation, rather than do nothing. It was
          understood, that either of the proposed measures pleadged the public faith to the final
          accomplishment of this great measure; and it was hoped would put an end to the intrigues
          of Foreign agents for its defeat; and would releive your administration from the
          embarrassments that might arise, if left as an open question.</p>
        <p>I did not understand you at any time, expressing a preference for the proposition of
            <name type="person">Col Benton</name> over that of the House, nor is it indeed probable
          that you would have done so as the whole body of your friends in both Houses, with the
          exception of four or five senators, favored the mode of annexation proposed by the
          resolutions of the House. Your uniform course was to urge the adoption of some measure,
          one or the other of the pending propositions; so as to have the question settled &amp; you
          frequently said, if the Bill of <name type="person">Col. Benton</name> should be adopted
          by Congress, that the most distinguished men of the country ought to compose the
          commission but I do not recollect that any individuals were named by you as the proper
          persons to compose it.</p>
        <p>The idea of uniting the two propositions and leaving it to the Pres to select which to
          act on, I do not remember to have heard suggested, until the evening of the <date when="--02-27">27th of February</date>, when the amendment of <name type="person">Robert
            J Walker</name> then a Senator from <name type="place">Mississippi</name>, was offered
          &amp; adopted; &amp; the <pb/>Resolutions thus amended passed the Senate the same evening
          &amp; finally passed the House the next day. Although the questions arising out of the
          measure as adopted were frequently subjects of conversation, I do not recollect that you
          expressed any opinion as to the proper course to be pursued until they were submitted to
          the cabinet. They were the first questions of importance brought before it by you.</p>
        <p>It appeared that <name type="person">Mr. Tyler</name> had taken up the subject and
          decided to act under that branch of the Law, known as the Resolutions of the House and had
          despatched a messenger with instructions to our Minister in Texas. There was much
          discussion, as to the influence, the course adopted by <name type="person">Mr.
            Tyler</name> should have upon his successor and as to the danger that would arise to the
          final success of the measure itself by any delay in executing the law, from the intrigues
          of the agents of foreign Governments, who were then understood to be actively engaged, and
          using every effort to defeat it. It was finally decided, as I now recollect without a
          dissenting voice in the cabinet, to abide by the decision of <name type="person">Mr.
            Tyler</name> and secure annexation if possible in the manner prescribed by the
          resolutions of the House. You concurred entirely with the cabinet and I do not remember to
          have heard a preference expressed by you for one proposition over the other until that
          time.</p>
        <p>Knowing the relations existing between you &amp; <name type="person">Mr. Blair</name> at
          the time and the above circumstances I could not but feel surprize upon reading his
          letter.</p>
        <p>
                    <pb/>The Amendment of <name type="person">Mr. Walker</name>, combining the two
          propositions &amp; giving the right to the Pres to select either, was first made late in
          the day of the <date when="--02-27">27h of February</date> and was finally acted on in
          that body the same evening. The Whig Senators were taken by surprize &amp; urged delay for
          an hour or two to consider the proposition; some of them threatening to speak out the
          balance of the session if it was then pressed to a vote and after a short adjournment for
          dinner was finally decided. I could not understand how the existing relations between
          yourself &amp; <name type="person">Mr Blair</name>, should have induced him, to have
          hunted you up, submitted to your consideration the important proposition of <name type="person">Mr Walker</name>, have obtained your decision &amp; reported it to certain
          Senators for the purpose of securing their votes for annexation, in a few hours after its
          introduction. I did not believe that you would have decided so important question, so
          hastily, without consulting with the friends you intended to call around you nor did I
          believe you would have communicated such a decision through <name type="person">Mr.
            Blair</name>. The selection of some other paper in lieu of the Globe and some editor
          more friendly to yourself than <name type="person">Mr. Blair</name>, had been under
          consideration of yourself &amp; friends, particularly <name type="person">Gov. A V
            Brown</name> &amp; myself, before that time and had been determined on by yourself, if a
          suitable person could be had. <name type="person">Mr. Blair</name>, had admitted into the
          columns of the Globe the most vile attack made upon you before the Baltimore nomination.
          He had omitted to publish in the Globe, the procedings of conventions &amp; other public
          bodies, urging your nomination for the Vice <pb/>presidency. His course had been so
          marked, whilst pretending neutrality between the candidates for the Vice presidency as to
          call forth the remonstrance of some of your friends here &amp; lead to a correspondence
          between you &amp; myself in relation to it.<note place="foot" n="1">This correspondence
            comprises <name type="person">Johnson</name>’s letters to <name type="person">Polk</name> of <date when="1844-01-13">January 13</date>, <date when="1844-01-21">21</date>, and <date when="1844-01-31">31</date>, <date when="1844-02-06">February

          amendment of <name type="person">Mr. Walker</name> that he would vote for it, which was
          regarded as an unerring index to the course of the other senators who had acted with him
          in opposition to the House resolutions, thus leaving no time for <name type="person">Mr
            Blair</name> to have searched you up and obtain your decision, to be communicated to
          Senators to control their votes. In addition to these things I may add, that after the
          adjournment of the Senate, when it was publicly known what decision you had made, as no
          nominations had been sent to that body for commissioners, <name type="person">Mr
            Blair</name> urged upon me, as a member of your administration and your personal friend,
          the importance of retaining the Globe as the organ of the Admn., explained the causes of
          the appearance of that unfriendly article in his paper, expressed the utmost confidence in
          you as a politician and a man and said with much emphasis, that if the Globe should be
          retained, he would “<hi rend="italics">strike down</hi>” the enemies of your
          administration as he had done those of <name type="person">Genl Jackson</name>.</p>
        <p>Whatever communications may have been made to <name type="person">Judge Tappan</name>,
          they could at the time have had no influence upon his feelings of friendship toward you or
          your administration or probably on his vote. <pb/>More than two years after the
          commencement of your administration, he repeatedly declared in my presence that <hi rend="italics">he &amp; his friends</hi> were the <hi rend="italics">only true</hi>
          friends of the administration in <name type="place">Ohio</name>, that he was the <hi rend="italics">only one</hi>, <hi rend="italics">able and willing</hi> to <hi rend="italics">advance money to sustain it</hi>, that he should continue to do so, not
          from any expectation of reward but because he believed the <hi rend="italics">President to
            be an honest man</hi> and regretted that the President had committed himself so early
          against runing a second time as he thought it probable that he was the only man that could
          unite the democratic party at the next election.</p>
        <p>It is somewhat remarkable that this alledged fraud to secure the votes of certain
          senators for annexation has been permitted to sleep for three &amp; a half years until it
          was distinctly ascertained that the influence of your admn. could not be brought to favor
          the nomination of <name type="person">Mr. Van Buren</name> whose friends seem to claim the
          right for him to succeed you by virtue of what they seem to have considered the last will
          &amp; Testament of <name type="person">Genl. Jackson</name> and that it was your duty to
          have it executed. Very soon after his nomination at Utica, it seems, an issue is attempted
          to be made with you, as the head of the Democratic party whereby the votes of those
          opposed to your admn., or who had been soured by disappointment, might the more readily be
          secured for the Buffaloe nominee, on his new plat form.</p>

          occupies the mind of the American People. Ineed not say, that my humble mite has been

        <p>It may not be improper for me to say to you, as yr term of Office is drawing to a close,

          the Country shall endure, yr Administration &amp; yr name will occupy a high &amp;
          enviable position. And in a few years, when the full benefits of some of the measures of

                    <name type="person">Mrs Polk</name>, yr most excellent lady, has contributed her full

        <salute>Sir.</salute>
        <p>I have the honor of submitting to your consideration, some notes in reference to the
          mineral resources of our vast territorial possessions, facing the Pacific Ocean.</p>
        <p>I recently addressed the Secretary of the Treasury upon this subject, in consequence of
          its bearing upon the trade &amp; commerce of our country, and of the world. And as it
          seemed to me, that the immense annual saving to the government, to be effected by the use
          of coal mined upon our own Pacific coast, made the subject deserving of the serious
          attention of the Departments of the War &amp; the Navy, I addressed a joint letter to the
          Gentlemen at their head.</p>
        <p>I also took occasion to tender my services, for the purpose of making such Geological
          &amp; Chemical investigation, as the interest of the country may render necessary.</p>
        <p>Whilst at <name type="place">Washington</name>, it was suggested to me, by those whose
          opinions were entitled to weight, that a subject of so much importance should be brought
          to the notice of your Excellency.</p>
        <p>Our countrymen, true to their Anglo-Saxon spirit, have busied themselves, for some years
          past, in investigating, or rather in expressing their opinions, as to, the value of those
          territories. Oregon has had some <pb/>share of attention, but many circumstances have
          conspired, frequently to bring up for discussion, the question of the usefulness of our
          territorial acquisitions from <name type="place">Mexico</name>, and for which the country
          is indebted to your policy.</p>
        <p>The proneness of mankind to form conclusions with a slight knowledge of facts, has
          produced frequent expressions of opinion adverse to the value of the territories in
          question.</p>
        <p>We have often heard of the sterility of most of the country west of the Rocky Mountains,
          and many will scarcely admit of its possessing anything worthy of notice, beyond that of
          harbors of refuge for our whalers.</p>
        <p>My own pursuits and tastes have led me to the consideration of the mineral constitution
          of the country, &amp; of the effects that may be produced by a full and timely
          developement of them. It has occurred to me, that, if we efficiently avail ourselves of
          the advantages of the position and resources of those regions, results will soon follow,
          little anticipated by those who are ordinarily satisfied with looking merely at the
          surface of things.</p>
        <p>Had our attention been turned to the subject of the mineral resources of <name type="place">California</name>, some quarter of a century ago, we should possibly have
          cared little for any others than the more costly metals. But it is far otherwise in the
          present day.</p>
        <p>The successful navigation of every sea, has been achieved in our <pb/>day, by means of
          steam, which must give rise to new channels of trade, and occasion many important changes
          in mundane affairs. Our country will be obliged to prepare for them, or be left behind in
          the great political and commercial race of the world.</p>
        <p>As a knowledge of the mineral resources of the territories on our extreme west seemed to
          me a subject of great interest, I recently visited the Seat of Government for the purpose
          of collecting information in reference to them. I regretted to find that so little was
          certainly known upon the subject, and was strongly impressed with the necessity that
          exists for a thorough and systematic investigation of the mineral resources of <name type="place">California</name> &amp; <name type="place">Oregon</name>, lying westward of
          the Sierra Nevada &amp; Cascade ranges of mountains.</p>
        <p>I have received a copy of an interesting memoir addressed to your Excellency by <name type="person">Ar H. Palmer Esq</name>. of <name type="place">New York</name>, upon the
          subject of the productive trade and resources of the countries bordering on, or enclosed
          by, the Pacific Ocean.<note place="foot" n="1">
                        <name type="person">Aaron H. Palmer</name>
            to <name type="person">Polk</name>, <date when="1848-01-10">January 10, 1848</date>, and
            enclosed memoir.</note> This Work, which reached me a few days since, relieves me from
          the necessity of troubling you with extended remarks, upon the importance of increasing
          our facilities for trade with the productive regions referred to by him.</p>
        <p>
                    <name type="person">Mr. Palmer</name> proposes means by which our enterprising merchants
          may become better acquainted with the capacities for trade, of the Eastern portions of
          Asia, and the Islands of the Pacific Ocean, and it is to be hoped, the course he suggests
          will be adopted; but at the same time it <pb/>may be remarked, that no mode of increasing
          trade is so sure as that of lessening the time &amp; cost of traveling between the
          different trading marts. As matters are at present, too much of the valuable time of the
          merchant would be consumed in sailing voyages of 5 to 8.000 miles. What now takes 3
          months, will be performed by steamers in one. Experience clearly proves that trade will
          take those routes on which cheapness and rapidity of motion are combined, especially if
          our countrymen are concerned in it.</p>
        <p>The waters of the great Pacific are unquestionably destined to be crowded with steamers,
          and the important question arises, shall we take means to enjoy our proper share of this
          vast trade? or shall we fold our arms and leave it all to Britain and other foreign
          Nations? Shall we not, at least, make an effort to turn a good share of it into our
          Pacific Ports?</p>
        <p>The <hi rend="italics">commencement</hi> of a steam communication with <name type="place">India</name> &amp; <name type="place">China</name> &amp;c, will no doubt consist of a
          line of mail Steamers, supported mainly at the expense of the public treasury.</p>
        <p>At present, the cost of sustaining such a concern would be so great as to present a
          serious obstacle to its institution. This mainly results from the heavy cost of shipping
          coal from England and this country. The expense of coal delivered at our California ports,
          [I am informed by Commodore Skinner, who is now taking measures to supply the naval
            steamers]<note place="foot" n="2">Brackets in manuscript.</note> is sixteen Dollars per
          ton!</p>
        <p>If we could mine it in convenient localities, near the coast, it might be produced for
          one fourth the sum, in <name type="place">California</name> &amp; <name type="place">Oregon</name>.</p>
        <p>
                    <pb/>In all future time, we must have abundant supplies of fuel for the use of the
          Steamers of the Navy, and yet we are not aware of the position of a single available coal
          bed, on our own soil on the Pacific. What, Sir, will be our condition, if we should be
          involved in a war with one of the great maritime powers? Russia possesses this all
          important resource near Bhering’s Straits, and Britain as you will percieve by the
            appendix,<note place="foot" n="3">
                        <name type="person">Tyson</name> may refer to a later
            paragraph of this letter or to <name type="person">Palmer</name>’s memoir. If the
            latter, however, he erroneously refers to chapter 6, not an appendix; chapter 6
            discusses British sources of coal more explicitly in the revised edition.</note> has
          already secured for herself the most ample means of supply at <hi rend="italics">many</hi>
          points. There are strong grounds for the apprehension, that, in the event of a war, she
          will have it in her power, by means of her steam marine, to exclude our vessels entirely
          from the waters of the Pacific.</p>
        <p>If we are to have an efficient steam marine in the Pacific, (as I had the honor to point
          out to the secretary of the Treasury) and this applies to the commercial, as well as to
          the public steamers, it will require a new basis, a basis of its own. It must have its
          Foundries, its Dock Yards, and its workshops; it cannot subsist by coal transported from
          here or England, nor can the machinery be refitted or replaced from the Atlantic. Means
          must be provided at one of our magnificent harbors in <name type="place">California</name>
          where anything needful can be done; otherwise the delays that would occur will be almost
          fatal to its existance.</p>
        <p>The production of Iron also, is nearly as essential to our full participation in the
          advantages of a steam marine, whether during peace or war. The cost of transporting iron
          for the purposes of the foundry in California is more than its cost in England at the
          present time.</p>
        <p>
                    <pb/>In reference to the probability of finding available beds of coal in <name type="place">California</name> or <name type="place">Oregon</name>, there is little to
          be said; but that subject will be referred to, presently. If coal fields of the “true”
          carboniferous era should be ascertained to exist, it is highly probable, to say the least,
          that the <hi rend="italics">usual</hi> iron ores will exist in them; and besides, we have
          reason to expect, in the mountains, the rich magnetic oxide, and the specular oxides, so
          valuable in other parts of the world.</p>
        <p>The journeys of our Military officers, in those countries, have usually been of a hasty
          character, and often with enemies around them. We could not therefore expect much
          information in regard to Geological details. The Civilians who have written and spoken, so
          far as I can find, give far less specific information, than our intelligent officers.</p>
        <p>Allow me to say that my remarks upon the subject of coal have reference, exclusively, to
          the coal of what is called by the Geologist, “<hi rend="italics">The Carboniferous
            formation</hi>, or <hi rend="italics">era</hi>.[”]<note place="foot" n="4">Closing
            quotation mark missing.</note> This is the coal of commerce and is often called “true
          coal” in contradistinction to the fossil fuel of the newer Geological eras, such as the
          Oolite &amp; Tertiary, which goes by many names, viz: Brown coal, Bovey Coal, Lignite
          &amp;c. This coal abounds in various parts of the world, and gives rise to many pretended
          discoveries of coal. It is always inferior, and rarely used except for the coarsest
          purposes. It occurs at Panama, and in large deposites along, or near, the Western coasts
          of So. America, as well as in Oregon.</p>
        <p>The high cost of coal induced the agent of the <name type="org">British South Pacific
            <pb/>Navigation Co.</name>, to mine (a few years since) this kind of fuel near
          Conception in <name type="place">Chili</name>. It seemed to be purer than usual, and was
          found to answer tolerably well at first, but the latest accounts are unfavorable and that
          company continues to send their coal from <name type="place">England</name>.</p>
        <p>We have had, and will no doubt continue to have, all kinds of reports of the existance of
          coal and every thing else in <name type="place">California</name> &amp; <name type="place">Oregon</name>. But my experience in connection with mineral matters, has given me
          abundant evidence of the proneness of mankind to accept for truth the smallest trace of
          evidence in such matters.</p>
        <p>This is more especially the case when a strong wish exists that such announcements may be
          true.</p>
        <p>I shall therefore, in laying before you what I can learn of the probability of the
          occurrance of coal, within our territories on the Pacific, confine myself to the most
          authentic authorities, and pay no regard to most of the stories upon the subject.</p>
        <p>1. Mr Palmer (in the memoir before referred to) says, on page 54. “Coal of an
          intermediate species between bituminous &amp; anthracite, burning more easily than the
          latter, but a little harder than the former, has been found in large strata, in the
          vicinity of Francisco.” This is exactly the kind best adapted to the use of Ocean
          Steamers. The authority for the statement is not given, &amp; it is to be regretted that
          we are obliged to conclude that no such strata are known to exist in <name type="place">California</name>.</p>
        <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">2.</hi>
          <name type="person">Lieut Col. Emory</name> affirms, as I have been informed, that no coal
          <pb/>of practical utility has been met with.</p>
        <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">3.</hi>
          <name type="person">Lieut Col. Fremont</name> informed me, that the only coal known in
            <name type="place">California</name> was a thin &amp; useless <hi rend="italics">seam</hi>, near San Luis Obispo, but whether even that belongs to the true Coal era,
          there are no means of judging.</p>
        <p>4. I have been obligingly furnished by the War Department with an extract of a letter
          from <name type="person">Col R. B. Mason</name>, Com[mandin]g<note place="foot" n="5">Letters or word here and below inserted to complete probable meanings.</note> in <name type="place">California</name> dated <date when="1848-04-18">18 Ap’l 1848</date>. The
          Col. seems alive to the importance of the subject, and, as you will percieve, took such
          means as were at his disposal, to ascertain the truth in reference to the various reported
          discoveries of Coal. The extract is as follows.</p>
        <p>“Feeling the vast importance of coal to a country like <name type="place">California</name>, I many months ago directed Lieut. Warner to explore the country
          north of <name type="place">Monterey</name>, and to visit some reported beds of Coal. He
          visited every place where coal was said to exist, and in one place found a single tree
          imbedded in rock and converted into carbon: of course it was of little or no value. He
          also found a thin film of coal of no value whatever; but most of the reported coal beds,
          consisted of Clay or sand, impregnated with Bitumen, which is very abundant on the coast
          especially at <name type="place">Santa Barbara</name>.</p>
        <p>The best bed of coal is 15 miles this side (north) of San Diego, in a high bank
          overhanging the sea. It is a stratum not exceeding at any point eight inches in depth. Two
            <name type="place">California</name> gentlemen are engaged in working it, hoping, as
          they penetrate deeper into the earth, it will become thicker: <pb/>but as its outcrop can
          be examined for many miles, at no point of which it exceeds eight inches in thickness,
          little or [no] reliance can be placed upon it for a supply of coal for the mail steamers.
          This bed was examined by <name type="person">Lieut Warner</name>, but he found no pieces
          thicker than two inches.”</p>
        <p>This at least is authentic &amp; dispels the illusion hitherto existing in the matter.
          And it shows conclusively that no workable or useful Coal was known to exist in <name type="place">California</name> six months ago. The account of the eight inch seam, near
          San Diego is of peculiar interest, because from the <hi rend="italics">uniformity</hi> of
          the seam over an extensive space, we have reason to believe, that it belongs to the true
          “Carboniferous era” inducing strong hopes that workable beds may exist in its vicinity, or
          elsewhere in the western portions of California or Oregon, &amp; which may brought to
          light by means of a Systematic Geological survey of the country.</p>
        <p>The “two Californians” will have reason to regret their useless labor in the 8 in. seam.
          It will not increase in thickness as they penetrate into it.</p>
        <p>In one of the papers addressed to the Sec’y of the Treasury, it was stated that there was
          reason to believe, that the two Geological formations, between which the Carboniferous or
          Coal formation is found, exist in <name type="place">Alta California</name>. The official
          reports seem to lead to this conclusion. It would also seem from what we have learned of
          the territories both of <name type="place">Oregon</name> &amp; <name type="place">California</name>, that if coal should be discovered, it will in all probability be
          found at no great distance from the coast.</p>
        <p>
                    <pb/>In conclusion I may say that I have forborne to call your attention to any other
          minerals except coal &amp; Iron, not because others of value, &amp; of great importance to
          commerce do not exist there, but simply because these are of paramount interest,
          sufficient to call for the prompt action of the government.</p>
        <p>We know that gold, silver mercury copper &amp; lead are found in our new territories. It
          may be presumed that a careful investigation of the country would develope valuable
          resources, &amp; it is to be hoped, would aid in turning the ignorant mineral hunters from
          many profitless &amp; abortive operations.</p>
        <p>For the mercury of <name type="place">California</name> there is a market near at hand.
          It is required in large quantity in <name type="place">Mexico</name>.</p>
        <p>In <name type="place">China</name> also we have a market for a vast quantity of both Lead
          &amp; Mercury.</p>
        <p>We need not fear a want of markets for the productive industry of <name type="place">California</name> &amp; <name type="place">Oregon</name>. As ample development of their
          resources will attract a large share of the enterprizing &amp; industrious of our race who
          will not fail to regulate their pursuits by the wants of the innumerable markets presented
          to them by their positions. They will have half of the population of the world to trade
          with, without leaving the waters of their own Great Ocean.</p>

        <salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
        <p>I have received your letter of the <date when="1848-09-09">9th of September, 1848</date>
          and have read <name type="person">Mr Tappan</name>’s printed letter to the Editor of the
          Evening Post of the <date when="--07-21">21st of July</date> last &amp; that of <name type="person">Mr Blair</name> to <name type="person">Mr. Tappan</name> of the <date when="--07-07">7th of July</date>.</p>
        <p>On your arrival in <name type="place">Washington</name> in <date when="1845-02">February
            1845</date>, I joined you there at your request, took lodgings in the same hotel, &amp;
          was very often with you. The subject which mainly engrossed the attention of Congress was
          the Annexation of Texas. That measure was one of the issues, on which the people had
          decided by your election; you expressed yourself to me anxious that the declared wishes of
          the Democratic party should have effect. A division of opinion on the proper form of
          annexation prevailed in the senate. You were indifferent as to the form, provided the
          substance was secured. You advised conciliation &amp; union, the adoption of a form of
          <pb/>resolution which would produce harmony and successful action, and you gave as your
          motive for this advice, your deep interest in the passage of the measure itself. You
          looked at the possible rejection of the measure, as a blow in advance at your
          administration. You seemed to me indifferent whether the house resolution prevailed or a
          substitute; I never heard you express an opinion about the details or form of the measure;
          and when an option of forms was proposed and accepted by the senate, you applauded the
          spirit of harmony which it manifested, but took care never to hazard the success of the
          measure itself by siding with either of the parties on questions of form. I remained to
          the last ignorant as to which of the two forms you would adopt; and had no reason to
          suppose that either was dissatisfactory. I never myself heard you discuss the relative
          merits of the two forms; still less did I ever hear you express a preference; nor did I
          hear in conversation with others, that you had done so.</p>
        <p>My nomination as one of your cabinet was not confirmed till the tenth of March. As soon
          as I heard of this, but not before, I repaired to your mansion, and was shown into the
          room where the cabinet had been deliberating. The election of the first &amp; second
          sections of the Joint resolution had been already approved, &amp; <name type="person">Mr
            Buchanan</name> was on the point of going away in order to forward a despatch to <name type="person">Mr Donelson</name>. Conversation ensued; and I was informed, that the
          decision which had been made before I was a member of the cabinet, had been the result of
          <pb/>the unanimous advice of the other five members. The reasons, which were given for
          their preference were: That <name type="person">Mr Tyler</name> and <name type="person">Mr
            Calhoun</name> had already made an election, which, it was found, could not be disturbed
          without some confusion; that <name type="person">Mr Donelson</name> was a remarkably
          prudent man, who might be relied upon under <name type="person">Mr Buchanan</name>’s
          instructions to conduct his part in the affair quietly &amp; without irritating; that the
          first &amp; second sections of the Joint Resolution were more favorable to peace with
            <name type="place">Mexico</name>, as they expressly reserved to the general government
          full power to negotiate a boundary with <name type="place">Mexico</name>; that Almonte had
          already, by demanding his passports on the mere passage of the resolution, rendered prompt
          action on our part imperative; that to delay action by the tedious process of a commission
          was but opening the way to <name type="place">Mexico</name> to inflame the public mind;
          that the delay would be almost an invitation to <name type="place">England</name> &amp;
            <name type="place">France</name> to employ commissioners on their part to prevent the
          consummation of annexation; and that the appointment of commissioners on our side to treat
          with <name type="place">Texas</name> on the terms of annexation would be almost a
          temptation to <name type="place">Texas</name> to make exorbitant and unreasonable demands,
          which the administration pledged as it was to the measure of annexation, would have found
          it most difficult to resist.</p>
        <p>I never heard from any one a hint, that the consultation of the Cabinet or your own
          decision, was in any embarrassed by any previous declaration as to the option which you
          would make.</p>
        <p>
                    <pb/>On the contrary, I always understood that the united Democratic party in the senate
          intended and desired to leave your judgment free; and when on the tenth of March 1845,
            <name type="person">Mr Berrien</name> attempted to draw from the senate an expression of
          opinion in favor of the third section of the resolution, the Democratic Senators on the
          eleventh of March signified their unwillingness to embarrass you by postponing <name type="person">Mr Berrien</name>’s motion indefinitely.</p>
        <p>Your approval of the election which <name type="person">Mr Tyler</name> had made, was
          immediately known. It did not change <name type="person">Mr Blair</name>’s willingness to
          be the confidential editor &amp; organ of the administration. He remained desirous of that
          post.</p>
        <p>I remember well our summer’s drive, a year later, to <name type="person">Mr
          Blair</name>’s house at Silver Spring. His reception was most cordial, as I had expected.
          He walked with us over the grounds nearest the house, &amp; showed us his various
          improvements. Of your administration he expressed himself in terms, such as I had
          repeatedly heard from him, &amp; such as were most gratifying to me to hear in your
          presence. He congratulated you on your good fortune in carrying out your measures, of
          which he expressed his approbation without qualification &amp; without reserve. I never
          heard any man give a tribute to your administration more comprehensive or that seemed more
          from the heart.</p>
        <p>I will add, that in all the stormy days which I witnessed in Washington, &amp; among all
          the complaints which always will follow the <pb/>exercise of power, I never heard of this
          complaint of <name type="person">Mr Tappans</name>; nor any fault found with your course
          on the annexation of Texas, except by those who did not want it annexed at all.</p>

        <salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
        <p>I send you today my reminiscences on the annexation of Texas, as far as your opinions
          were concerned.<note place="foot" n="1">Bancroft enclosed his other letter of <date when="1848-10-13">October 13, 1848</date>.</note>
                </p>
        <p>I add two considerations. <name type="person">Tappan</name> says your election of the
          House resolution <hi rend="italics">placed “the United States in a state of war with <name type="place">Mexico</name>
                    </hi>.” The man is beside himself. The Senate’s action was
          quite as unmindful of <name type="place">Mexico</name>, &amp; even more so. This shows how
            <name type="person">Tappan</name>’s memory &amp; judgment are both at fault.</p>
        <p>Next. For Senators to have voted a compromise on which you were to be arbiter, &amp; to
          have solicited your decision in advance, would have been dishonest. The compromise implied
          freedom of election on your part. It would have been a fraud on the majority of the
          Senate, to have passed a resolution with an alternative, when there was to be no
          <pb/>alternative at all. <name type="person">Mr Tappan</name>’s charge lies heaviest on
          himself. I do not think the subject merits much of your attention. The calumny is foolish.
          In substance the two modes proposed are identical. Each annexes Texas, &amp; with or with
          out the leave of <name type="place">Mexico</name>.</p>
        <p>I most ardently hope for your sake, for the sake of the country, for the sake of <name type="place">Europe</name>, for the sake of the world, that Cass may be elected. The
          whole conservative force of England prays for his defeat. His success will be your own
          triumph. I wish I could witness it.</p>
        <p>Pray find time to write me, but above all, in your last message, do not fail to speak in
          words that will make Europe leap. Speak specially in favor of the federative principle. In
          Austria a plan to have the Ban of Croatia come &amp; take Vienna, has led to a new &amp; a
          more determined insurrection. The bad faith of kings, at a time, when if they were honest,
          they could do great good, leads to convulsions &amp; will lead, alas, through bloody
          scenes to republican forms of Government. If France would but learn the benefit of States
          Right, of provincial liberties, she would redeem Europe.</p>
        <p>Best regards to <name type="person">Mrs Polk</name>. Will you come to <name type="place">Europe</name> after the close of your wearisome but most glorious struggles?</p>

        <salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>I return to you the letter of <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr
            Fallon</name>
                    </hi> respecting <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="place">Cuba</name>
                    </hi>,
          which you enclosed to me for my perusal.<note place="foot" n="1">Neither <name type="person">Fallon</name>’s letter nor <name type="person">Dallas</name>’s letter to
              <name type="person">Polk</name> has been found.</note> From what I had before learned
          from <hi rend="italics">an Official source</hi>, the information which <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr F.</name>
                    </hi> gives, did not surprise me.</p>
        <p>The result of the late election in <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> was unexpected,
          <pb/>though I am far from believing that the state will be lost to the Democracy in
          November. I have not heretofore regarded the success of the Democratic party in the
          Presidential election as doubtful, or that any thing was likely to happen to make it so.
          If however the great state of <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name>, should give way, and
          vote with our opponents we may be defeated. Can this be possible? Will you give me your
          opinion on the subject? I am aware of the embarrassment which is produced in some of the
          Northern States, by the secession of a few prominent democrats, and their Union with the
          Abolitionists, under the more popular name, of the advocates of free soil, but I had hoped
          and believed there were but few such in the staunch old Democratic state of <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name>. Surely these Democratic leaders must now see, that the
          only effect of further persisting in their course, must be not to advance their own <hi rend="italics">single idea</hi>, but to aid the Whigs to overthrow the Democratic party
          and policy. If they persist in their course, the effect will be the same as if they were
          to vote for the Whig candidate. Some of them I know are ready to go this length, to
          gratify their personal revenge upon the Democratic party, for failing to apprciate, as
          they think they should have done, their merits, but I hope there are very few of this
          class. My attention was called a few days ago to a statement of a letter-writer in a <name type="place">New York</name> Barn burner paper, to the effect that my old friends <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Judge Kane</name>
                    </hi> and <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Horn</name>
                    </hi> were in favour of the free soil ticket as it is
          called. I could not believe the statement &amp; hope it is not true. They have always been
          democrats, and <pb/>though they may retain strong personal attachments for <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr V-B.</name>
                    </hi>, they surely cannot on that
          account, be willing to see, the great principles and the policy they have so long approved
          &amp; supported, reversed and over-turned, as it would be, by the defeat of the Democratic
          candidates in this election. With kind salutations to <name type="person">Mrs.
            Dallas</name> and your daughters: . . . .</p>

                        <name type="person">Addison</name>
                    </hi> including the price of the mule. This I
          request you to do, and to retain the amount you may pay her out of the price of my cotton,
          when it may be sold. I have directed my present year’s crop to be shipped to your House in
            <name type="place">New Orleans</name> as heretofore. I take it for granted that
          insurance <pb/>against the dangers of the River, will be taken out by your House.</p>
        <p>The price of cotton is still at a very low point. Should the troubles in Europe be at all
          quieted I think it must soon rise. Under all the circumstances however I conclude to say
          to you, and you can so instruct your House in <name type="place">New Orleans</name>, that
          they are authorized at their discretion to sell, both crops, last year’s and this, or such
          of the latter as they may have [. . . account]<note place="foot" n="2">Words here illegible
            or uncertain and letter below missing, light ink transfer.</note> at an average price
          not less than 6. cents per pound. If I cannot get an average price of 6. cents per pound,
          I will retain both crops for another year. I do not think it probable that the disturbed
          state of Europe [s]hall continue to be such as to keep the price down at the present point
          much longer.</p>

        <salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>A due regard for the proprieties of the public position which I occupy, must necessarily
          prevent me from mingling as a partisan in the <pb/>pending Presidential election. I am at
          liberty however to express freely and without reserve my opinions, and these I do not
          conceal. I am then, free to declare that I have never known a period, when the result of
          any political contest was of greater importance to the country. My administration I
          venture to hope has been reasonably successful, and it is very natural that I should
          desire to see my public policy maintained and carried out by my successor. Should <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Genl. Cass</name>
                    </hi> be elected I have great
          confidence this will be done. The country is prosperous in spite of the embarrassments to
          her foreign commerce which must be temporary, <note place="foot" n="1">
                        <name type="person">Polk</name> may have meant to place “which . . . temporary,” which he inserted with a
            caret, between the commas.</note> produced by the political disturbances abroad. During
          my term, <name type="place">Texas</name> has been annexed, the Oregon question has been
          settled, the <name type="place">Mexican</name> war closed by an honourable peace, adding
          an immense empire to our territory, and I flatter myself with the belief, that at no
          former pe[r]iod,<note place="foot" n="2">Letter inserted to complete probable
            meaning.</note> has our country, stood higher in the respect of all Europe than at the
          present. Should <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Genl. Cass</name>
                    </hi> be elected,
          (as I think he will be) the important question of organizing Territorial Governments in
            <name type="place">California</name> and <name type="place">New Mexico</name>, upon
          principles of mutual concession and compromise, which shou[l]d<note place="foot" n="3">Letter or letters here and below cut off side of page.</note> be satisfactory to all
          sections of the Union, wil[l] be settled without difficulty. Should our opponents succeed,
          this will be kept an open qu[es]tion for political agitation, and will destroy t[he]
          harmony, if not endanger the Union itself, by dividing the country into geographical
          parties. If <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Cass</name>
                    </hi> is elected I have
          great confidence, that it wi[ll] give my administration such strength, as will enable me
          to settle <pb/>this only remaining question of difficulty before I retire. Should our
          opponents, by any possibility come into power, their President must, from his total want
          of civil qualifications, be in the hands, and wholly under the control, of such political
          leaders as <hi rend="italics">

                    </hi>, <hi rend="italics">

                    </hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. and the whole
          policy of my administration Foreign and domestic, must be reversed and overthrown. Can the
          country desire this? I hope not. The chances are greatly in favour of <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Genl. Cass</name>’s</hi> election, though, the division of
          parties in several states is so close, that there is a possibility of his defeat. The vote
          in the late State election in Pennsylvania has been unexpectedly close. Causes however
          operated in that election which cannot be brought to bear in November, and I am far from
          believing that we are in any serious danger of losing that great state. <name type="place">Ohio</name> I consider perfectly safe. Next to carrying the general election I feel the
          greatest anxieety, that <name type="place">Tennessee</name> (my own state) should by her
          vote endorse her approval of my administration. I know that the contest must be a close
          one, but I believe with the proper exertions the state may be carried, and it might
          possibly happen that her vote would decide the result. I was exceedingly gratified to
          learn from <hi rend="italics">

                    </hi> is a clever fellow and an
          honest man. I have always been upon excellent personal terms with him, and greatly desired
          his election to the Senate of <pb/>the <name type="place">United States</name>. He ought
          to have been elected and could have been if our Democratic members of the Legislature
          ha[d] acted with any prudence and common-sense. The old issues, of Bank, tariff &amp;c,
          o[n] which we differed, are no longer issues. H[e] agreed with us, upon the <name type="place">Texas</name> question, the Mexican war, and I have no doubt will agree with
          us upon the Territorial questions, in <name type="place">New Mexico</name> &amp; <name type="place">California</name>, and there is nothing of principle therefore to prevent
          him from acting with us hereafter. The Whigs and especially the leaders in <name type="place">Tennessee</name>, <hi rend="italics">Bell</hi>, <hi rend="italics">Foster</hi>, <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Jones</name>
                    </hi> &amp;c., have no
          political sympathies for him. His friends in the State must hereafter be among the
          Democrats. From his position he has it, at this moment in his power to control more votes
          than any man in the State. If he could be induced to make a single political speech,
          assigning his name for the support of <hi rend="italics">Cass</hi> in preference to <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Taylor</name>
                    </hi>, the fact that he had done so,
          would as soon as known, control hundreds of [votes]<note place="foot" n="5">Word here and
            below uncertain, light ink transfer.</note> among his old friends. If in addition to
          this, he would make a tour on the eve of the election, through <hi rend="italics">Blount</hi>, <hi rend="italics">Sevier</hi>, [<hi rend="italics">Knox</hi>,] <hi rend="italics">Granger</hi>, <hi rend="italics">Anderson</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italics">Roane</hi>, I should consider the result of the election in the State as certain for
            <hi rend="italics">Cass</hi>. If he would do this, the whole democracy of the state
          would be under lasting obligations to him. When you see him, make my respects to him, and
          communicate to him, how much I am gratified, at the information given to me on yesterday
          by <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Cave Johnson</name>
                    </hi>. You may too if you
          choose, express to him my hope, that he will for the few days which will intervene before
          the election, give to us his active aid in this <pb/>our time of need.</p>

        <p>In casting my eye over the accompanying letter, which, was written at a late hour last
          night, after the close of a day of unceasing attention to business in my office, I see no
          objection to your submitting it to the perusal of <hi rend="italics">

                    </hi> if you choose to do so. It was not written with any
          such view, but it occurred to me, when I was about addressing it to you, that it might be
          gratifying him to know my views and opinions <pb/>upon the topics to which it relates. If
          you shew it to him, you will of course do so, <hi rend="italics">confidentially</hi>, as

        <p>We have just terminated a pivate conference of our friends, the result of whose
          deliberations is that we can carry the state, with proper means; All the active men of the
          party seem determined to work, with all their might. We have arranged a sytem of
          operations that will reach every neighborhood in the state and we have all contributed our
          money liberally. It has been determined to apply to our friends at <name type="place">Washington</name>, for assistance, and with this view <name type="person">Mr
            Brenner</name>, a merchant, and a disinterested democrat, will call on you. He will be
          accompanied by <name type="person">Mr. Jones</name>, a reliable democrat from Berks
          county.</p>
        <p>I beg that you will give your influence to operate upon the heads of department the
          Auditors, &amp;c. Let them contribute as they should do, and we cannot fail of success.
          All we need to ensure victory is to have our <pb/>voters out, &amp; the means must be
          provided, or we will fail.</p>

        <salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
        <p>I wrote to you last week<note place="foot" n="1">
                        <name type="person">Bancroft</name> to
              <name type="person">Polk</name>, <date when="1848-10-13">October 13, 1848</date> (both
            such letters).</note> in reply to yours of the ninth of September. The more I think of
          the matter, the less seems to me the importance of the effusions, which malice engenders
          in friends of disappointment, &amp; which find an audience only during the moments when
          public passions are heated by political contests. After the seventh of October,<note place="foot" n="2">Bancroft probably meant to write “November.”</note> nobody will think
          of listening to anything so foolish as the suggestion that one branch of the Joint
          Resolution for annexing <name type="place">Texas</name> made war with <name type="place">Mexico</name> more likely than the other. <name type="person">Tappan</name> had in his
          memory confused a motion of <name type="person">Benton</name>’s of an earlier day for
          negotiations with <name type="place">Mexico</name>. His own statement destroys itself. It
          is [whird]<note place="foot" n="3">Word here and below illegible or uncertain, blurred ink
            transfer.</note> only to give annoyance. No one can attach moment to it.</p>
        <p>The eyes of the world are on you. I am very anxious that your final message should be a
          faultless document: every way suited to the condition of a country which is looked to as
          an example by every people <pb/>in the civilized world.</p>
        <p>
                    <name type="person">Mr. Brodhead</name>, now secretary of this Legation, is you know
          desirous to be appointed to the Office poor Martin held at Rome. He is a most amiable man,
          and one who, of all the men I know, would make himself most useful and most acceptable to
          our country men traveling to <name type="place">Rome</name>. He has skill in eleven
          languages, is a prudent man, and has had experience in Diplomatic usages &amp; life. He
          has been to me a very pleasant associate; and I could not do less than bear this testimony
          to his merits.</p>
        <p>This country, in the midst of all the revolutions around it, is as full of apathy as
          possible. There is no movement: no combing of the fabric; no rending of the wall. And yet
          there is a deep foreboding of the future. How it will come I cannot certainly foresee: but
          it seems to me, the form revolution will take here, is through the finances. The questions
          about the income tax &amp; the corn-law will shake England pretty thoroughly, when the
          income-tax requires renewal, &amp; when the corn laws reduce materially the price of corn.
          But as yet habits of Subserviency to the aristocracy are so branded into the national
          character, that the people generally are satisfied with their institutions. They keep down
          pretty well their envy at our success, their consciousness that we are going forward full
          of hope, while their future is clouded; but a growl against the results of your
          administration is sometimes heard; and they dread the very name of Cass, as of one who
          would swallow Pococatapetl at a bite, make <pb/>but one mouthful of Canada, and help the
          Irish any way he can. But after the seventh of November, they will speak of him in more
          kindly terms. The candidate of the Whigs may pass current with his party, if <name type="place">England</name>’s endorsement of him is sufficient.</p>
        <p>My best regards to <name type="person">Mrs Polk</name>.</p>

        <salute>Dear Sir!</salute>
        <p>I received a letter from <name type="person">William Voorhies</name>, in which he
          mentioned that he had held a conversation with you on the propriety of my accompanying him
          to <name type="place">California</name>, and concluded by insisting on my joining him. I
          am entirely at Sea with regard to my future movements, I am trammelled by my Wife’s
          Northern prejudice against a Southern home. I feel the necessity of moulding some bold
          design by which prosperity and possibly fame may be the reward, but in all candor, I know
          not where to begin. Can you suggest a beginning point? If you think it best for me to
          “pull up stakes” and go immediately to California, please favor me with the considerations
          that forms the opinion. I know you would not advise me without proper reflection, and I
          entertain great defference for your judgement.</p>
        <p>The prospect in <name type="place">Tennessee</name> for our cause is growing more
          <pb/>satisfactory—from all I can learn—from all the indications—I am decidedly of the
          opinion that we will carry the State. In forming this opinion, I am entirely controlled by
          the evidences, suggested by the general tone of the public mind. Our friends are
          confident, the reasonable Whigs admit a doubt. We have a preponderance of the active
          talent in the field, and if the State is not carried in the present contest we never can
          carry it. I have made some speeches in this County, and the best sign is, that the Whigs
          seem disposed to reason, not in the spirit of their accustomed violence, but with a decent
          forbearance. The Centeral Committee is active—nearly every County in the State is
          thoroughly organized. Every effort is being directed to bring out our full vote.</p>
        <p>Coe is with Jones and I learn defending your Administration with warmth. I will attend
          their meeting at Mt. Pleasant on the 23d, when I will be better able to give you a correct
          idea of his manner of debate. He may have reasoned himself into a proper estimate of his
          folly in bracing himself against you, however after hearing him I can better judge.</p>
        <p>Write me without delay, for if a movement toward California has to be made, I must be
          preparing to make the move. My Wife sends her respects to <name type="person">Mrs
            Polk</name>. Mother is very well!</p>

        <salute>Highly honoured and Well Beloved Friend.</salute>
        <p>The Constituent Assembly at <name type="place">Frankfort</name>, on the <date when="--06-28">28th of June</date> last, elected me <hi rend="italics">Vicaire</hi> of
          the German Empire. The Resolution of a free people, and the patriotism of its Princes,
          have confided to me, until the definitive establishment of the <name type="place">German</name> Constitution be completed, a power which is thus called to take a new and
          legal place, in the Councils of Nations. <name type="place">Germany</name> will not forget
          the amicable manner, in which the <name type="place">United States of America</name>
          responded to her enthusiastic efforts, to rise to legal liberty and unity, and
          acknowledged them, even before the existence of an official organ, which could, as I now
          do, present the news of this great movement, to the knowledge of the American Nation. I
          hereby inform you, My Most honoured and highly Beloved Friend, of my acceptance of the
          provisional direction of the Government of Germany; and I appoint <name type="person">Frederick Ludwig von Roenne</name>, formerly accredited at <name type="place">Washington</name>, as Minister of Prussia, who will deliver to you this letter, as my
          Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, near the <name type="place">United
            States</name>. It <pb/>was the most ardent desire of the Provisional Central Power of
          Germany, even before information had been received, of the appointment of an American
          Envoy, in the highly acceptable person of <name type="person">Mr Donelson</name>, to be,
          without delay, represented at <name type="place">Washington</name>, by an Envoy accredited
          to its Government, in the usual form. Nothing besides the care required to select a
          representative, in every respect worthy of this honourable and important post, has delayed
          the dispatch of an Envoy, until this period. The personal knowledge which I have, of the
          qualities of <name type="person">F. L. Von Roenne</name>, and the good services which he
          has already rendered, in the international intercourse for the advantage of Germany as
          well as the <name type="place">United States</name>, afford me a guarantee, that his
          exertions will henceforth be, in a still greater degree, beneficial to the two
          countries.</p>
        <p>I therefore pray you, My Most highly honoured and Well Beloved Friend, to receive my
          Envoy with kindness, and to grant to him a favourable hearing and entire creditt in all
          that he may say to you, on the part of the Central Power of Germany, most especially when
          he expresses the amicable and sincere wishes of Germany for the welfare of the United
          States of America. I remain . . . .</p>

        <salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>I received to day, your letter of the 13th Instant, together with the one enclosed of the
          same date, in answer to mine of the 9th of September, for both of which I thank you.</p>
        <p>I heartily unite with you, in the wish that <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Genl.
              Cass</name>
                    </hi> may be elected and I think he will be. The unexpectedly close vote in
          the late State election in <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name>, has given an intensity
          of intrest to the Presidential election which it did not before possess. Causes however,
          (which it is not necessary to specify) operated in that election, which no longer exist,
          and my information induces the confident belief, that the electoral vote of <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> will be given for the Democratic ticket. If I am right
          in this, the question is settled. That <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="place">Ohio</name>
                    </hi> will vote for <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Cass</name>
                    </hi>
          &amp; <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Butler</name>
                    </hi> is no longer a matter of
          doubt. Even without <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name>
          <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Genl. Cass</name>’s</hi> chances are the best, but
          the contest in that case, would be close, and the result might be a matter of some
          doubt.</p>
        <p>I agree with you, that in the present condition of the world, my closing annual Message
          to Congress will be an important one. It has so happened that my administration, has
          occurred at an eventful pe[r]iod<note place="foot" n="1">Letter inserted to complete
            probable meaning.</note> in the history of our own country and of the world. Great
          questions have arisen foreign and domestic, which it has been my duty, to meet—with what
          sucess must be left to the future historian to record. You kindly <pb/>suggest that in the
          next Message I should speak in terms that will “make Europe leap,” and especially of our
          federative system. The theme I know is an ample one. In treating it, you from your
          position possess many materials which I cannot have. If you were with me a single day you
          could aid me much. As it is, My Dear Sir: I should esteem it a personal favour, if you
          would put down in writing, any views which you may think proper to suggest and transmit
          them to me by the return Steamer. Congress, will meet on the 4th of December and on the
          following day according to usage, my message will be sent in. If the outward and homeward
          passage should be of the ordinary length, there may still be time for me to receive your
          views. Should they be too late for that occasion, there may be some other during the
          Session, when it would be proper to use them.</p>
        <p>I am most anxious to receive from you copies of the documents in the Brittish archives
          relating to the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence in <date when="1775-05">May
            1775</date>, and every thing, which may relate to the proceedings of the people in that
          part of <name type="place">North Carolina</name>, about that period. My own immediate
          family were activee participators in those proceedings, and therefore every thing
          connected with them, will be of peculiar intrest to me.</p>

        <salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>I was gratified to receive your letter of the 21st Instant.<note place="foot" n="1">Letter not found.</note> I hope you may be right in the confident opinion which you
          express, that <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> will give her electoral vote to the
          Democratic candidate at the approaching Presidential election. One apprehension which you
          express, gives me some concern, and it is in truth our only danger in <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> or elsewhere. It is, that the <hi rend="italics">Free Soil men</hi>
          of the Whigs will to a great extent desert their candidate, and go for <hi rend="italics">Taylor</hi>, while the Democrats of the same creed will more generally hold to their
          ticket. Can nothing be done, during the few days which yet remain to prevent this? Surely
          the <hi rend="italics">Free Soil</hi> Democrats must see, that the only effect of
            th[. . .]<note place="foot" n="2">Letter or letters here and below cut off side of
            page.</note> course must be to endanger the election of the Democratic candidate. I
          cannot believe, if the subject is presented to them in the proper light, that they can be
          willing, to overthrow their party and its principles, by with-holding their votes, and
          thus contributing indirctly to the election of <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Taylor</name>
                    </hi>. I hope many of them who have heretofore approved and supp[or]ted
          the Democratic policy, may reconsider their determination to <pb/>vote for a ticket tha[t]
          can by no possibility succeed, and that they may yet act with their old frieds. With the
          vote of <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name>, I consider our success as certain beyond
          all doubt. Without it we may succeed, but the contest, will be very close and must be
          regarded as doubtf[ul]. <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="place">Tennessee</name>
                    </hi> you
          know has been for years a debateable state. In the present contest my information is, that
          our chances are decidedly the best. Can nothing be done to convince the Democrats of <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Wilmot</name>
                    </hi>’s District, of the danger of
          adhering to the <hi rend="italics">Free Soil</hi> ticket. They cannot desire <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Taylor</name>’s</hi> election. <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr. Wilmot</name>
                    </hi> himself I learned shortly after the
          Baltimore convention, avowed his intention to support <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Genl. Cass</name>
                    </hi>. If he could be induced to return to that ground
          he would contribute largely, to place the State beyond doubt. Are you intimate with him?
          Regarding the present election, as of vast importance, no honourable means should be
          spared, to secure our success. I am retiring, and can have no other intrest in it, than
          that which is common to every citizen, who believes as I do, that upon the continuance of
          the existing policy, will depend the future prosperity of the country. If our opponents
          should come into power, (though they may make no such professions before the election) I
          regard it as certain that, the existing policy will be reversed, and all the leading
          measures of my administration be over thrown. I am much gratified that you take so deep an
          intrest in the matter, and I hope you may be able to convince, some of our erring
          Democratic brethren, &amp; induce them to act, with their old party and their old friends
          in the great trial, which is just at hand.</p>
        <p>
                    <pb/>I think very well of the capacity and fitness of the Democratic friend whom you
          recommend for office, and would be glad to gratify his wishes. I am under some
          embarrassments in regard to the particular position you name, and cannot now speak with
          certainty, as to what I may deem it my duty to do, in regard to it. In any event, I hope I
          may have it in my power before the close of my term, to serve the frind you name. I have
          hertofore sincerely desired to do so, but have been so embarrassed by the circumstances
          around me as to prevent it.</p>

        <salute>Sir</salute>
        <p>Having a claim against the Government of <name type="place">Mexico</name> for services in
          its navy under Commodore Porter and others, I was on the point of having it paid by their
          own positive order before the war as were settled those of other foreigners in similar
          cases, but being an American it was withheld from me and I was otherwise persecuted on the
          same account.</p>
        <p>Since the restoration of peace I demanded payment again, and have been answered that it
          was just, right and proper that it should be <pb/>paid, although they plead at the same
          time the excuse of some law, which they pretend is against it at present, notwithstanding
          they have appropriated to themselves other money of mine as a motive of paying it; but the
          most weighty reason against it which they do not express, is, their well known animosity
          to Americans in general since the war and particularly to me and others who like myself
          have been associated with the American Army here.</p>
        <p>Under these circumstances it is in vain for me to think of obtaining said payment without
          some countenance, aid or support from the <abbr>U.S.</abbr> Government, and as they have
          confessed that they are bound to pay it, and it being besides an injury which has resulted
          to me on account of the war, I most respectfully solicit, that your Excellency will be
          pleased to have issued such instructions as may be deemed proper, to the American Minister
          here in favour of it, supposing myself entitled to some consideration on the part of the
          Government at home, not only as an American citisen, but also for my services to the
          American Army whilst here, in whose toils and dangers I participated in the staff of the
          first division, and to every Department of which I rendered more or less assistance.</p>

        <p>My son <name type="person">Lieut Donelson</name>, who seperated from me in <name type="place">Switzerland</name>, with my Daughters, to visit <name type="place">Rome</name>, has been so much interrupted in his route, that he has not yet joined me

          grant him the favor of an extension of his furlough to the 1st of April for which I have
          applied without his knowledge to the War Dept. His conduct at West Point is a pledge that
          the favor asked will be improved to the benefit of the country. His piety, intelligence,
          and thirst for information, inspire me with great hopes of his future usefulness, and I
          shall regard it as a great favor to have this request gratified.</p>
        <p>
                    <name type="person">Mr. Bagby</name> remained a few days here with me. He seemed
          confident of the Democratic victory in the present election: but the papers continue to
          show that the race is a close one. According to my count the event turns on <name type="place">ohio</name>, and as I have never had much faith in the politics of that
          state I have never been sanguine of the success of our ticket. There is a charm in <name type="person">Genl Taylors</name> no party declaration which added to his military
          merit, prepare me to hear that <name type="person">Mr. Bagbys</name> anticpations are not
          realised.</p>
        <p>The free soil movement is the most dangerous one made against <pb/>the harmony of our
          Union: Assisted by the Foreign vote which will be hereafter increased by the process of
          emigration from <name type="place">Europe</name> it may be considered a trial for us
          almost as dangerous as the socialism of <name type="place">Europe</name> to her peace and
          tranquillity. But I will not tax you with my thoughts on the subject. I congratulate you
          that you are near the close of your arduous labors, and that your administration has been
          so successful.</p>
        <p>The papers will give you the details of the siege and capitulation of <name type="place">Vienna</name>. Affairs are not much better here. The Assembly and the King are
          preparing for a great conflict. Ministers succed each other on the stage of Politics, with
          as much rapidity as on an ordinary Theatre. All is disorder.</p>
        <p>Read my despatch no. 99, containing a recent interview with the King. It must gratify you
          to see the increasing respect felt for our country and that as difficulties increase here
          Kings are willing to take advice from so poor a character as I am.</p>
        <p>I am pressed by the <name type="person">Arch Dukes</name> friends at <name type="place">Frankfort</name> to return, but I hope to receive first powers to negotiate. It is more
          than I can bear too to stand the expenses of frequent visits of that kind, unless I can be
          allowed an outfit which I think I am fairly entitled to. A little reflection will satisfy
          you, that at such a period as this, thown into contact with all the excited political
          elements of Europe, it is impossible for me to practise the economy which is usual with
          our ministers.</p>
        <p>I gave <name type="person">Baron Roenne</name> a letter to you.<note place="foot" n="2">Letter not found.</note> He is an amiable man, not weighty enough for the storm which

        <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
        <p>It is sometime since the free soil party, that portion of them that formerly belonged to
          the Democratic party in this State, have entirely dropped the good old name and adopted
          the name of, free soilers, (the leaders I mean) who under that name intend, to, and do,
          spread their sails so wide, as to take in, all sorts and complexions of parties, <hi rend="italics">provided always</hi>, that they are opposed to all the old &amp;
          established usages of the Democratic party including regular Nominations and among the
          leaders, I am sorry to say the evidence is <hi rend="italics">too strong</hi> for <hi rend="italics">douts</hi>, is our old friend, <name type="person">Jacob Gould Esq</name>

          he holds under you, through the great &amp; Successful struggle of the Democratic party of
            <date when="1844">1844</date>.</p>
        <p>If as I believe there can be no douts, he has voluntarily abandoned the Democratic party,
          and declines to sustain their regular Nominations, <pb/>he has no longer any claim to
          their patronage. I hope you will appoint as his successor <name type="person">Frederick</name> Lansing Esq of the County of <hi rend="italics">

          will be satisfied we all consider him, as he has been, a valuable man to the Democratic

          &amp; for other expences, or to write me what amt she had paid out &amp; I would either
          pay the money over to her son Sam, or send it to her as She miught desire.</p>
        <p>She wrote Sam that <name type="person">Addison</name> had been sick. I advised her not to
          send him until he was well and out of danger of a relapse. I expect to hear from her in a

        <p>As the election approaches we are getting up a little excitement in <name type="place">Tennessee</name>. If we can get out our full vote I hope we may carry the state. The
          whigs live near the towns &amp; voting places &amp; Are more apt to go to the polls than
          the Democrats. I dont think we will make Any gain in <name type="place">West

          <pb/>election. If we can do this, I think Middle <name type="place">Tennessee</name> will
          give us the state. The vote must be close &amp; the chances are about <hi rend="italics">even</hi>.</p>
        <p>As to cotton I am very much discouraged as to the prospect ahead. The crop will be a
          large one &amp; unless we have more quiet times abroad we cant look for much improvement.
          If I had cotton &amp; was not obliged to have the money I would <hi rend="italics">not</hi> sell it at present.</p>
        <p>Chester, who is well informed about <name type="person">Wm H Polk</name>’s lands, advises

        <p>I had your house Insured Immediately on geting your letter of the <date when="--10-11">11th Octr.</date> and directed the cirtificate to be forwarded to you which I have just
          learned from <name type="person">Mr. Butler</name> clerk in the office was done. I had
          retained Insurance on the wing &amp; considered <name type="person">Mr Hughs</name> bound
          for the balance of the house until the keys were delivered which is certainly the case
          &amp; Insured by your orders because I concluded that you would <pb/>rather pay a months
          insurance than have to recover of <name type="person">Mr. H</name>.</p>
        <p>
                    <name type="person">Mr Hughs</name> did not desire to make you a cheaper finish in making
          the flooteed columns with wrought capitals but to make one more expensive because he
          thought it handsomer. He will make the sliding doors as pr contract but is doing nearly
          all the work finer than was promised as he allways told me he would. Your house exceept
          the plastering will be the finest inside finish in <name type="place">Nashville</name>
          &amp; therefore I have been much tempted to order the front halls &amp; Parlors to be
          handsomely finished with cornis &amp; centre flourishes as is now being done in all the
          fine houses here. The cost as represented to me by <name type="person">Hugh</name> who is
          anxious to have it done would be slightly over two hundred dollars additional making your
          whole improvement say eleven thousand dollars. If you desire this &amp; say so by
          Telegraph it probably will not be too late.</p>
        <p>Our Election is all mixed up so much so that there is no knowing what will be the result;
          there has been and still is much excitement all sprung up within a few days in which your
          Brother <name type="person">William H</name> had something to do but it has all been today
          closed the party with whoom he had difficulty having declined to answer his call
          &amp;c.</p>

        <salute>Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>I was sorry to learn from <name type="person">Cave Johnson</name>, &amp; thro’ <name type="person">Doct. Ramsey</name>, that there was some apprehension at <name type="place">Washington</name>, of <name type="person">Taylor</name>’s election. It
          should only prompt his opponents to increased exertions. The proposal to elect him is
          simply disgraceful &amp; an insult to the good sense of the Union. It invokes a morality,
          lying deeper, if possible, than politics. I learned confidentially from <name type="person">Doct. Ramsey</name>, &amp; directly from our friend <name type="person">Cave Johnson</name>, what you &amp; he thought I might accomplish in our end of <name type="place">Tennee</name>. Had the fears entertained, as to the general result, occured
          to us, a month earlier, &amp; thus, the probable deciding importance of this state, there
          is nothing in my power, that I would not have contributed, unasked; for, ever since the
          nominations, I have been operating on individuals of the old Whig party, &amp;, with
          considerable effect; mostly <pb/>dissuading them from voting, where I could not get them
          into an affirmative position for <name type="person">Cass</name> &amp; <name type="person">Butler</name>. I am confident I have affected two or three hundred in this way in <name type="person">E. Tenee</name>. This, I thought, might somewhat counterpoise the inroads
          into the democratic forces, with which <name type="person">Taylor</name> evidently started
          out, this side of the mountain. I still believe Cass will finally get Tenee. by fifteen
          hundred, by non-voting of <name type="person">Clay Whigs</name>. If this be not so, then I
          am profoundly in the dark. Had I the funds to spare I would freely give ten thousand
          dollars to defeat <name type="person">Taylor</name>, especially defeat him in Tenee. if
          that would decide the election; so important in every aspect, do I regard <name type="person">Cass</name>’ election at this time. But you are mistaken in supposing that
          any one man could do so much, as you ascribe to me, <hi rend="italics">so immediately
            before the election</hi>. When we heard from you,<note place="foot" n="2">
                        <name type="person">Polk</name> to <name type="person">James G. M. Ramsey</name>, <date when="1848-10-17">October 17, 1848</date>.</note> it so happened that I was, &amp;
          had, for weeks been perplexed &amp; my time annoyed &amp; consumed by a multiplicity of
          deviltries—such as hunting night &amp; day for some of my negroes, run away by instigation
          of d—d abolitionists here &amp; also other of my negroes levied on for judgements obtained
          on notes got from me by extortion; &amp; I was in the midst of my efforts to enjoin those
          scoundrelious judgements when I heard from you &amp; <name type="person">Johnson</name>.
          Actually the most that my time enabled me to do, was, to publish a short analysis of the
          Taylor absurdities; selecting only a topic or two, to demonstrate by. You will perceive,

        <salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>In three days more the period for speculation in regard to the result of the Presidential
          election will have passed. I have high hopes of success. My hopes greatly preponderate
          over my fears. Still when I reflect <pb/>that there are not less than ten or a dozen
          states, in which the parties are so nearly equally balanced, that an acccident, or
          superior exertion on the day of election may carry them either way, I cannot conceal from
          myself that there may be a possibility, a bare possibility of defeat. The States referred
          to are, <hi rend="italics">Connecticut</hi>

        <salute>Sir:</salute>
        <p>I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the <date when="--09-30">30th of September</date> last, and in compliance with your request to furnish you with
          a statement, so far as within my knowledge, of all your opinions, views or acts, as well
          before as after your inauguration as President, relating to the subject of the annexation
          of <name type="place">Texas</name> to the <name type="place">United States</name>, proceed
          to reply as fully as my memory will serve me at this date, detailing at the same time the
          progress of this question in the Senate of the United States.</p>
        <p>On the <date when="1845-02-04">4th of February 1845</date>, the Committee of Foreign
          Relations of the Senate, to which had been referred the consideration of the joint
          resolutions which passed the House for the admission of <name type="place">Texas</name> as
          a state of the Union, reported in favor of the rejection of those resolutions. On the
          succeeding day <name type="person">Mr. Benton</name> introduced his bill to provide for
          the annexation of <name type="place">Texas</name> to the <name type="place">United
            States</name>. A motion was made by an opponent of the bill to refer it to the same
          committee on Foreign Relations which had but the day preceding reported against the
          annexation of <name type="place">Texas</name>. This motion was resisted by me, and failed
          by a <pb/>single vote. Upon that occasion, on referring to the files of the Congressional
          Globe of that date, I find by my remarks as then reported, that whilst my decided
          preference of the House resolutions was expressed, it was accompanied by the avowal, in
          case of the failure of these resolutions, to take into consideration the bill of <name type="person">Col. Benton</name>. On the conclusion of this speech, I was addressed in
          the Senate chamber by <name type="person">Mr. Francis P. Blair</name>, then the Editor of
          the Globe, who seemed much gratified by my remarks, and requested me to retire with him
          for the purpose of an interview on the subject. We accordingly proceeded to the room of
          the Committee of the Judiciary of the Senate, where <name type="person">Mr. Blair</name>
          stated to me that the House resolutions could never pass the Senate, designating the names
          of several democratic Senators whom he stated as of his own personal knowledge never would
          vote for those resolutions, and requested me, as the only means of preventing the defeat
          of the measure, to agree to support the bill of <name type="person">Mr. Benton</name>,
          assuring me, if I would do so, that it could be substituted as an amendment in the Senate
          to the House resolutions, pass that body, go to the House and be concurred in and become a
          law. I told <name type="person">Mr. Blair</name> that I was bound in good faith to support
          the joint resolutions of the House, and besides, I preferred them, as more prompt and
          certain, and as conforming to my own plan of admitting <name type="place">Texas</name> as
          a State as proposed by myself in that form in <date when="1844">1844</date>, <date when="1835">1835</date> and <date when="1826">1826</date>. I told him that it was quite
          possible that <name type="person">Mr. Benton</name>’s bill might by a united whig vote,
          with the aid of such <pb/>democratic Senators as were opposed to the House resolutions, be
          substituted for them in the Senate, but that if this were done, the whig Senators opposed
          to the annexation would then vote against <name type="person">Mr. Benton</name>’s bill,
          and as I feared also would several southern democratic Senators, and that in this way the
          great measure of annexation would be defeated. I then told him that there was one method
          which had occurred to my mind, growing out of the remarks made by the Senator from
          Missouri, under which the question could be saved; that <name type="person">Col.
            Benton</name> in his speech that morning had made it an objection to the House
          resolutions, that <name type="place">Texas</name> would reject them, and prefer his plan;
          that such was not my opinion, but I was willing to submit the decision to her judgement,
          and that I would suggest for his consideration, whether it might not be preferable to
          offer <name type="person">Mr. Benton</name>’s bill as a new section to the House
          resolutions, presenting the alternative for <name type="place">Texas</name> to decide
          which she would prefer, and that in this manner the friends of the House resolutions might
          in a manner perfectly fair and honorable unite with <name type="person">Mr. Benton</name>
          and his friends in supporting the whole measure thus associated and amended. <name type="person">Mr. Blair</name> seemed much pleased with this suggestion, and said he
          would consult <name type="person">Col. Benton</name> upon the subject, and a day or two
          afterwards he informed me that <name type="person">Col. Benton</name> would support the
          measure in this alternative form, rather than that annexation should be defeated. It will
          thus be perceived, that I was the first to propose the uniting of <name type="person">Col.
            Benton</name>’s bill with the House resolutions as an alternative, <pb/>which facts,
          together with my avowed preference for the House resolutions will be found stated
          substantially by <name type="person">Mr. Blair</name> in an editorial of the Globe of the
            <date when="1845-03-26">26th of March 1845</date>. Upon receiving this information I
          prepared the amendment, a copy of which is annexed,<note place="foot" n="1">
                        <name type="person">Walker</name> enclosed a copy of his original amendment, which (1) gave
              <name type="person">Texas</name> the option “to negotiate with the <name type="place">United States</name> for admission into the Union” and (2) gave the president, if
            Texas selected that option, the choice between codifying the resulting “terms” in a
            “treaty” or in “articles to be submitted to the two Houses of Congress.” D, copy,
            possibly in McClintock Young’s hand. <abbr>DLC–JKP</abbr>.</note> to offer as an
          additional section to the House resolutions, leaving the choice between <name type="person">Col. Benton</name>’s bill and the House resolutions to <name type="place">Texas</name>. The original amendment as thus prepared by me, is now in my possession,
          and was shown to many of the friends of <name type="place">Texas</name> at that date. I
          think this amendment was put in form by me on the <date when="--02-08">8th of
            February</date>. Various efforts subsequently were made to ascertain with certainty
          whether the resolutions thus amended could be adopted; and I entertained hopes that the
          measure would succeed in that way, until, I think the <date when="--02-24">24th of
            February</date>, when I was informed by <name type="person">Mr. Haywood</name> of the
          Senate that there were several democratic Senators who would not vote for the resolutions
          in that alternative form, which assurance he gave me as of his own personal knowledge as a
          settled and unalterable fact, and he stated to me that unless my amendment as proposed to
          be offered, could undergo some modification, the great measure of annexation would be
          defeated, for the success of which <name type="person">Mr. Haywood</name> expressed, and I
          believe felt the utmost solicitude. From these representations made by <name type="person">Mr. Haywood</name> to me, and which I then believed and still believe, that the
          amendment in the form in which it had been drawn by me could not succeed without some
          modification, I asked <name type="person">Mr. Haywood</name> to suggest the modification
          <pb/>which in his judgement would carry the measure. He then assured me that if I would
          change my proposed amendment so far as to leave the alternative to the decision of the
          President of the <name type="place">United States</name> in lieu of <name type="place">Texas</name>, that <name type="person">Mr. Benton</name> and his friends would all vote
          for the amendment, and that if I would support it he entertained no doubt but that the
          Senators friendly to the House resolutions would then give it their vote, and that in that
          form the measure could succeed. He suggested also the importance of the amendment being
          offered by me, to which I assented, in case I became satisfied that the measure would
          succeed in that form and no other. I then changed my own amendment so far only as it
          substituted the President of the <name type="place">United States</name> for <name type="place">Texas</name> in deciding which should be preferred, the House resolutions
          or the bill of the Senate, and after consulting with some of my friends in the Senate,
          became convinced that they would support it, and so informed <name type="person">Mr.
            Haywood</name>, who assured me that <name type="person">Mr. Benton</name> and his
          friends were still all determined to vote for the resolutions in that form; whereupon, at
          six o’clock on the evening of the 27th of February, the hour being thus noted on the
          Senate journal, I offered the amendment, convinced on that day for the first time that
          success was certain, and that in no other form could the measure be carried; and on that
          same evening my amendment was adopted by a vote of 27 to 25, and the joint resolutions of
          the House as thus amended passed the Senate the same evening, subsequently passed the
          House and became a law. It was not until the morning of the <pb/>
                    <date when="--02-24">24th
            of February</date> according to my recollection that the suggestion of changing my
          alternative amendment was first made to me. This communication, as before stated, was made
          to me by <name type="person">Mr. Haywood</name>, and I never communicated with you in any
          manner on that point, nor, so far as I know, did you have any knowledge of the change
          proposed, or of my determination upon the subject. Indeed, notwithstanding my intimate
          relations with you at that time, being about to become a member of your cabinet, I did not
          feel disposed, as a Senator of the <name type="place">United States</name>, to confer with
          you as to this particular form of amendment, when, by its provisions, you were to be made
          the umpire upon the subject, nor would I have ever consented to offer the amendment if you
          ever had expressed to me any choice between the two alternatives. Nor did I know how you
          would decide the question; nor did any one ever intimate to me that you had ever been
          consulted upon the subject, or that you had either formed or expressed any opinion in
          regard to the choice of alternatives. After the resolution, as amended by me, passed the
          Senate, you expressed to me your gratification at the result, and again when it passed the
          House, but without alluding in any way to your opinion as to which alternative ought to be
          adopted, nor did I ever express any opinion to you on that point until the question was
          introduced at our first Cabinet meeting. Then I learned that President <name type="person">Tyler</name> had acted already upon the subject, and adopted the House resolutions on
          the <date when="1845-03-03">3rd March 1845</date>, the last day of his official term. At
          this Cabinet meeting, you presented the question for the <pb/>consideration of the Cabinet
          as to what course ought to be pursued by you in regard to these alternatives, giving no
          opinion yourself upon the subject, and having formed none, so far as was known to me. It
          was then suggested by some member of the Cabinet, but by which of them I do not recollect,
          that President <name type="person">Tyler</name> having already acted upon the subject, and
          decided the question which by the law he was authorized to do, and despatch[ed]<note place="foot" n="2">Letters either absent or cut off side of page.</note> the messenger
          with that decision to Texas, the question possibly might be regarded by some as placed
          thus beyond your control. On that question of power, I am not aware that any decision was
          made by the Cabinet or yourself, because we were all at once unanimously of opinion that
          it was best under all the circumstances of the case to adopt the alternative presented in
          the House resolutions as the most certain to secure annexation. You listened attentively
          and without interruption or expressing any opinion yourself of the views given thus
          promptly and unanimously by your Cabinet, when you announced your concurrence in opinion
          with them, and it was resolved that the Secretary of State should send a despatch to that
          effect to <name type="place">Texas</name>, confirming the selection made by President
            <name type="person">Tyler</name>. I was confident then, as I am now, that you had never
          committed yourself in any way on this subject. If you had, it certainly must have been
          known to some member of your Cabinet, and if you felt embarrassed by any such commitment,
          you might very readily have relieved yourself by placing the decision upon the choice
          already made by the President, your predecessor, under the powers devolved upon him by
          <pb/>law. I will here add, that I never heard even a suggestion that you had committed
          yourself in any way on this subject, or expressed any preference for the Senate or House
          resolutions until I read the letters of <name type="person">Messrs Tappan</name> and <name type="person">Blair</name> in the Evening Post of the <date when="--07-28">28th of
            July</date> last. I think it possible you may have stated to <name type="person">Mr.
            Blair</name>, either when <name type="person">Mr. Benton</name>’s bill was pending
          alone, or when it was offered by me as an alternative, that if that mode of annexation
          were adopted, you would appoint the most able men in the Union of both parties as
          Commissioners, but that you ever did say that you would yourself select <name type="person">Mr. Benton</name>’s bill as an alternative seems to me absolutely
          impossible, and I have no doubt that this idea is the result of a misapprehension of your
          views on this subject, which might have arisen very readily in case you had said that if
            <name type="person">Mr. Benton</name>’s bill were adopted as the alternative, you would
          appoint such commissioners. It would have been more satisfactory if the parties who
          labored under this misapprehension had stated the date of this alleged conversation with
          you, because the amendment as originally proposed to be offered by me, and which was drawn
          up and considered for several weeks and intended to be offered, left the decision of this
          alternative to <name type="place">Texas</name>, and rendered it impossible that you should
          undertake to decide the question. Nor was it until the 24th of February that any change in
          this alternative was suggested to me, nor until the 26th that I finally agreed to offer
          it. It was offered by me on the evening of the 27th and passed the Senate the same evening
            <hi rend="italics">without adjournment</hi>. <pb/>There could then have been but little
          time after the suggestion of leaving the alternative to the choice of the President of the
            <name type="place">United States</name> for such a conversation with you, and still less
          time to have conversed with the several Senators friendly to that mode of annexation, and
          to have communicated your views to them, and still more extraordinary that this important
          fact should have remained unknown to me and as I believe to every member of your Cabinet
          until divulged in the columns of the Evening Post in July last.</p>

        <salute>Sir/</salute>
        <p>I have received your letter of the <date when="--09-30">30th September</date> last,
          inviting my attention to two publications in the New York Evening Post of the <date when="--06-28">28th July</date>, bearing the signatures of <name type="person">Benjamin
            Tappan</name> &amp; <name type="person">Francis P Blair</name>; and requesting me to
          furnish you a statement of all I may know of any opinion, views or acts of yours, as well
          before as after your inauguration as President, relating to the subject of the annexation
          of Texas to the United States.</p>
        <p>It is proper before I proceed to state my knowledge upon this subject, that I should
          declare, in answer to one of your inquiries, that when the subject of the annexation of
            <name type="place">Texas</name> was before the Senate of which I was then a member, I
          had no knowledge nor information of the statements made by <name type="person">Messrs
            Tappan</name> &amp; <name type="person">Blair</name> in their publications.</p>
        <p>On the day, or the day but one, after your arrival in this City on the evening of the
            <date when="1845-02-13">13th February 1845</date>, you tendered me the office of
          Secretary of State. Between that time &amp; the day of your inauguration, I saw you
          frequently and had several confidential conversations with you on various topics connected
          with the policy you intended to pursue as <pb/>President of the United States; but in none
          of these did you ever express any preference either for the House Resolutions, or the
          Resolution of the Senate, for the admission of Texas into the Union, nor had I ever heard
          it intimated that you had expressed such a preference to any other person. I might add,
          that according to my best recollection, I had no knowledge of which alternative you would
          adopt until Monday the <date when="1845-03-10">10th March 1845</date>, the day of the
          first regular Cabinet meeting.</p>
        <p>On the morning of that day I was qualified as Secretary of State before <name type="person">Judge Catron</name> &amp; immediately entered upon the duties of the
          office. Afterwards, on the same morning, I read in cabinet, the Despatch of <name type="person">Mr. Calhoun</name> to <name type="person">Mr. Donelson</name>, dated on
          the <date when="1845-03-03">3d March 1845</date>, by which the latter was instructed to
          present to the Government of <name type="place">Texas</name>, as the basis of the
          admission of that State into the Union, the two first resolutions as they had passed the
          House of Representatives. Some member of the Cabinet, I do not now recollect the
          individual, suggested, that as President Tyler had already made his election in favor of
          the House Resolutions, it was doubtful whether President <name type="person">Polk</name>
          possessed the power to reverse this decision of his predecessor &amp; adopt the third
          resolution or amendment of the Senate. This question was not decided; because it was
          found, after a brief interchange of opinions, that yourself &amp; all the members of the
          Cabinet, without hesitation, were clearly &amp; decidedly in favor of the House
          Resolutions, in preference to the Resolution of the Senate. We all then believed, as I
          still believe, that the selection of the <pb/>Senate’s amendment would have delayed &amp;
          jeoparded, if it had not altogether defeated the annexation of Texas. There was not the
          least hesitation, on your part, in arriving at this conclusion.</p>
        <p>This point being settled—after consultation with the Cabinet, you deemed it important
          that a Despatch should be immediately transmitted to <name type="person">Mr.
            Donelson</name> confirming the selection which had been made by <name type="person">Mr.
            Tyler</name> of the House Resolutions; but modifying <name type="person">Mr.
            Calhoun</name>’s Despatch in certain particulars which I need not specify. I then left
          the Cabinet in session, completed my despatch of the <date when="--03-10">10th
            March</date> &amp; obtained your approval of it on the same evening, &amp; sent it off
          to <name type="person">Mr. Donelson</name> by the late Governor Yell of Arkansas.</p>
        <p>[In all our subsequent intercourse, I have never heard you utter a sentiment inconsistent
          with the strong opinion which you expressed, at the first Cabinet meeting, in favor of
          the House Resolutions.]<note place="foot" n="1">

        <p>The returns of the election is to me &amp; I have no doubt to most of <pb/>our friends
          unexpected. What can be the cause of the loss of <name type="place">Pennsylvania</name> I

          although I then beleaved that we would be with you most certain of sucsess, and I am now
          convinced that my judgement was then correct. With you I do not beleave we would have at
          this time been beten, and it is to you the democrecy of the nation four years from now
          must look to be again triumphant &amp; renew the measures of the party which I fear with
          the administration which is coming into power will be overthrown. This you may think &amp;
          perhaps is making an early calculation on the events of four years but they are now my
          candid opinions. Pleas present my reguards to <name type="person">Mrs Polk</name> &amp;

        <salute>Sir.</salute>
        <p>Having been requested by the Committes of Public-buildings of the Senate &amp; House of
          Representatives to prepare a description and estimate of suitable and necessary fixtures
          for lighting the public grounds, <pb/>
                    <name type="place">Pennsylvania Avenue</name> &amp;
          the residence of your Excellency, in which it was required that the Iron pillars &amp;
          Lamps &amp;tc should be of heavy weight and suitable design to correspond with the general
          character of the Buildings and places where they may be located; And appropriations having
          been made by Congress designed to carry out the same in the best manner &amp; with the
          understanding that all the necessary fixtures for completing the lighting thereof should
          progress without delay so as to be in readiness for the ensuing Congress, I feel it my
          duty to apprise your Excellency that I have ascertained that Lamp posts, Lanterns &amp;c
          have been contracted for by the Commissioner of Public Buildings of improper weight &amp;
          description, not anticipated or intended by Congress or fit or suited for the places
          intended, or even for the public streets of any City much less the Public Buildings. I
          would also state that numerous difficulties are interposed by the said Commissioner
          calculated to prevent the execution of these works till a late period of the ensuing year
          if continued in, that these interruptions are of a nature uncalled for &amp; of an
          improper character &amp; believe the whole to arise from the great want of competency in
          the Commissioner of Public Buildings which is further evinced by the manner other public
          works under his supervision are being done.</p>
        <p>Knowing no other mode to pursue than to address your excellency on the subject I have so
          far tresspassed with a view to prevent the Misapplication of Monies &amp; ensure the
          accomplishment of works intended by Congress.</p>
        <p>
                    <pb/>I would only further state, I have no interest in anything relative to the above,
          more than a common Citizen . . . .</p>

          things here are in <hi rend="italics">statu quo</hi>. Not an incident has occurred that is
          worth relating. The House is very quiet. <hi rend="italics">

          day. After that I invited <hi rend="italics">Hal</hi> to join us as a guest during your
          absence. He is delighted at his promotion from the pantry, is very prompt in his
          attendance and is the first at the table. <hi rend="italics">

          evening, and you may calculate to learn that we gave a grand reception to our
          visitors.</p>
        <p>
                    <pb/>As you leave home so seldom I hope you will take full time for your visit. I am

        <salute>Sir:</salute>
        <p>I have received your letter of the <date when="--09-30">30th of Sept.</date> last,
          calling my attention to a publication, in the <name type="place">New York</name> Evening
          Post, of the <date when="--07-28">28th July</date> Ulto., of two letters bearing the
          signatures of <name type="person">Benjamin Tappan</name> and <name type="person">Francis
            P. Blair</name>, and requesting me to furnish you a statement of all that I may know in
          regard to any opinion, views or acts of yours, as well before, as after your inauguration
          as President, on the subject of the Annexation of Texas to the United States, and the mode
          of its accomplishment.</p>
        <p>
                    <pb/>On your arrival at the seat of Government, in the month of <date when="1845-02">February 1845</date>, I called to pay my respects to you. I did not again meet you,
          until at your invitation on the first day of March, I visited you at your lodgings, and
          was requested to accept a situation in your Cabinet. In that, and another interview which
          took place on the next day or the day after, when I accepted your offer, we had a frank
          and unreserved conversation on the measures of your administration. One of the most
          prominent was to complete the Annexation of <name type="place">Texas</name>. The
          accomplishment of this object, you considered as one of your highest duties, in connection
          with the circumstances of your election. There was no intimation, whatever, that you had
          formed any opinion, or indicated any preference as to the mode in which the measure of
          annexation, already so near its consummation, was to be effected. As a member of President
          Tyler’s Cabinet, I had advised the adoption of the plan proposed in the House Resolution,
          as preferable, because more simple and more certain of success than that proposed in the
          amendment of the Senate.</p>
        <p>When the subject came before your Cabinet for consideration, on the <date when="--03-10">10th of March</date>, the despatch of <name type="person">Mr. Calhoun</name> to <name type="person">Mr. Donelson</name> on the subject was read, the opinions of the members
          present given successively and unanimously in favor of the alternative selected by
          President <name type="place">Tyler</name>. You listened to the opinions of the members,
          without interruption or remark, and stated your concurrence with-out hesitation, and
          without <pb/>the slightest appearance of embarrassment or doubt. <name type="person">Mr.
            Bancroft</name> subsequently came in, and expressed his concurrence in what had been
          done. My position in reference to the question made me a close and anxious observer of
          what passed: And I unhesitatingly declare, that there was nothing in your manner, or your
          remarks, which left on my mind the slightest doubt, that you had approached the
          examination without any commitment or preference in favor of the Senate proposition.</p>
        <p>I had no reason to doubt that the alternative propositions had been fairly adopted by
          Congress, and the selection left, in good faith, to the Executive, without pledge or
          commitment by him in favor of one or the other. And I never heard an intimation that any
          such preference had been indicated by you, much less any pledge given, until I read the
          publication referred to.</p>
        <p>At the called Session of the Senate, which immediately followed your inauguration, you
          made no nomination of commissioners to treat with <name type="place">Texas</name>, which
          was conclusive evidence that you had not adopted the Senate plan. At the next session of
          Congress you communicated what you had done; and in all the conversations which I held
          with you, confidential and unreserved, I never saw in your manner or acts, or heard any
          thing to justify a suspicion, that you had disappointed any just expectation, of a course
          of conduct on your part, in regard to annexation different from that which you had
          pursued.</p>

        <salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>I wrote to you on yesterday in answer to your letter of the 3rd Instant in which I left
          it to you to decide, whether the additions you proposed in the finish of the front Halls
          and Parlors, should be made or not. I informed you that I did not understand distinctly
          what they were, but left it to your judgment, to decide on the propriety of making them. I
          could not understand what the “centre flourishes,” you mention, meant. <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Majr. Graham</name>
                    </hi> has just called in, and I enquired of
          him. He at first thought they must be figures drawn on the floor to dance around. Over
          this idea we had a laugh. He presently bethought himself however, that they must be
          figures in the ceiling over-head. Whatever they may be, I conclude to say you that I think
          the $200. which they will cost will be worth more to me than the additi[ons]<note place="foot" n="1">Letter or letters here and below cut off side of page.</note> or
          improvements which you propose. The Hous[e] will cost me more than I at first supposed
          &amp; I prefer to have it finished according to the contract, without any additional
          expe[nse]. You wrote to me when you made the contract with <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Huges</name>
                    </hi>

              23, 1848</date>.</note> that my letter to you of the 12th of February last, was
          incorporated into <pb/>the contract and made a part of it. By turning to that letter, of
          which I retained a copy, you will find the following passage, <hi rend="italics">viz</hi>., “If in the progr[e]s[s] of the work you discover any addition or improvement,
          proper to be made, you ha[ve] a right to direct it, and they are to d[o] the work, so as
          to make the establishm[ent] a complete one, with out extra charge fo[r] it.”</p>
        <p>If this clause is a part of the contract, as I understand it is, the manner in which the
          work shall be finished, is entirely under [yo]ur control, and the additions if any, which
          you [m]ight direct, should be made without further [c]harge. All however that I mean now
          to say [i]s that I prefer to have the work done according to the contract &amp; your
          understanding of it, without being subject to the payment of the additional two hundred
          dollars. I prefer to pay no more than I have contracted to pay.</p>

        <salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>You cannot regret more deeply than I do, the unfortunate result of the late election. I
          regret it on your own account, and still more on account of the country. It would have
          been most gratifying to your numerous friends to have seen you elevated to the
          high-position, which by your long and valuable public services, you so well merited. In
          your hands, even your opponents must admit the Government would have been ably
          administered, and your political friends know that sound principles would have marked our
          public policy foreign and domestic. But it is useless now to indulge unavailing regrets.
          Your frinds have one proud reflection, and that is, that you openly avowed your
          principles, and with the dignity which becomes a candidate for the Presidency stood
          <pb/>upon these. Neither yourself nor your friends, made secret pledges or wrote,
          inconsistent letters to different sections to defraud the people and secure votes. Though
          defeated, you stand to day, more honored than those who have resorted to such despicable
          means. You have the further consolation that you had a great party who stood by you to the
          last, and you will continue to have their respect and their admiration.</p>
        <p>I take it for granted that the heterogenious mass of <hi rend="italics">Federalists</hi>,
            <hi rend="italics">Natives conservatives</hi>, <hi rend="italics">disappointed
            office</hi>-<hi rend="italics">seekers</hi> and the odds and ends of every faction,
          which, from any cause has fallen off from the Democratic party, for the last twenty years,
          who, by their combined efforts and frauds upon the mass of the people, have elected <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">General Taylor</name>
                    </hi>, will require him to
          reverse the whole public policy, under which the country is now so prosperous. Indeed such
          are already the unmistakeable indications in the National Intelligencer and in other
          Quarters. <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Genl. Taylor</name>
                    </hi>, poor old man!
          can have no mind of his own, for he has no fixed principles, and is totally ignorant of
          public affairs. He will probably have but little more to do, in dircting public affairs,
          than <hi rend="italics">Queen Victoria</hi> did when she ascended the Brittish throne. It
          is the first instance in our history, in which the Government will be committed to a <hi rend="italics">ministry.</hi> It is not difficult to foresee that such an
          administration, made up of discordant and heeterogenious materials cannot long adhere
          to-gether, and I predict, that before the middle of the first session of Congress after
          its installation, it will be not only a total failure, but that the party which
          <pb/>brought it into power, will dissolve into its original elements and go to piecees.
          The misfortune is, that the country will be the sufferer. Until the eve of the election I
          did not believe the result which has taken place possible. When I last wrote you I thought
          defeat possible, though my hopes greatly preponderated over my fears.<note place="foot" n="1">

        <salute>Dr. Sir,</salute>
        <p>As your honored name has always been upheld and praised for benevolence towards the poor
          and miserable of this vale of tears, and as I claim to belong to that class of wretched
          beings. And having been very unfortunate, in our glorious war with <name type="place">Mexico</name>, in the battle of Buena Vista, where I fought with all the valour of a
          true soldier, until a ball from A Mexican Carbine passed through my right arm, shattering
          it so much that amputation was necessary. When I arrived at home, I was made acquainted
          with the woful news of the death of my dear wife. So I am now left in this world with nine
          children looking to me for support, without having the means to do so. Hon’d sir let me
          intrude upon your benevolence, and permit me to ask, a pittance in aid of a poor and
          wretched being. Any sume sent will be thankfully recieved &amp; acknowledged. May God
          bless you.</p>

        <salute>Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>Pressed as I am just now by several engagements, I snatch a few moments before the mail
          of to-day closes, to write a line or two of condolence upon the national disaster, &amp;
          degradation of the 7th instant. Our disappointment, here, &amp; hereabouts, &amp;
          throughout Tennee., is great indeed; not greater, however, than it is throughout the
          thirty States. <name type="person">Gov. A. V. Brown</name>’s most careful &amp; searching
          calculations, were utterly set at naught. Knowing that a considerable &amp; most
          respectable accession of old Whigs had voted for Cass, we were utterly confounded when we
          were told the vote of <name type="place">Knox</name> county. The result here (which I
          suppose to be a type of the State) was a mystery to us, until the next day revealed to us
          the fact, <pb/>that something more than two hundred of the hard-fisted democracy had been
          engaged on the 7th in being scared at home or appearing at the country polls for <name type="person">Taylor</name>. The non-slaveholders, even in slave regions, have been
          reached by Taylorism &amp; Northern Free Soilism, by a species of masonry which has
          distinguished this election from all I have ever heard of. Positively we find ourselves in
          this region unable to hear of any military enthusiasm as having been connected with the
          result. The Tennee. Whigs, you know, are <hi rend="italics">conscientiously</hi>! opposed
          to partaking of the <hi rend="italics">spoils</hi>! Yet, I already hear that the friends
          of <name type="person">Jno. Bell</name> &amp; <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Jas C
              Jones</name>
                    </hi>, respectively, speak of them for a place in <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Taylors Cabinet</name>
                    </hi>! <name type="person">Jno</name>’s official
          despatches, if without other merit, would at least be <hi rend="italics">length-y</hi>.
            <name type="person">Jimmey</name>’s, I suppose, with the aid of <name type="person">Old
            Zack</name> himself, would be <hi rend="italics">strength-y</hi>.</p>
        <p>Now, you must pardon me for naming another subject. I refer to our friend <name type="person">Doct. J. G. M. Ramsey</name>. I named the subject to him. He admitted his
          contingent desire upon the subject, but expressing, most candidly, his distrust of his
          qualifications, said, he would not, for ten thousand dollars, lower himself in your
          estimation, by naming a wish that might not be compatible with your duty or, with the
          public interest. He prides himself on your personal regard &amp; would certainly interdict
          this communication if he knew I was making it. If the appropriation for the Board to
          adjudicate claims under the <name type="place">Mexican</name> treaty, should be made, in
          time, the coming winter, I suppose you would appoint three Commissioners to sit at <name type="place">Washington</name>. I believe it has been usual to <pb/>constitute such
          Boards of at least one Lawyer, a practical commercial man, &amp;, indifferently, a third
          man of some other profession. In the latter category, I thought of the Doct. I thought of
          him because I knew he desired, before long to have a History of Tennessee, he is about
          completing, printed in Phil or <abbr>N.Y.</abbr> &amp; I thought a sojourn in <name type="place">Washington</name> for a while, would enable him by frequent communications
          through the Telegraph, to superintend the work. I only make the suggestion. You know, far
          better than I can know, what would be your duty on such a subject. I see no man quite so
          sad about the result of the election as the Doct. In addition to his patriotism
          disappointed, he has been particularly annoyed &amp; bedeviled by the course of his
          brother-in-law, <name type="person">Jno. H. Crozier</name>.</p>

        <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
        <p>The election has resulted as in <date when="1840">1840</date>. and by the same means: Yet
          you are not to take this election as a condemnation of your administration—the Whigs
          refused to take issue upon any one measure of it. But if the election has setled anything,
          it is, that the people in the <pb/>non slave holding Stats are in favor of the Wilmot
          proviso, and in the Slave holding States opposed to it; as <name type="person">General
            Taylor</name> was run—North as a provisoist and South as opposed to it, and this was the
          great issue both <abbr>N. &amp; S.</abbr>
                </p>
        <p>Now Sir, I take it for granted that you will recommend to Congress the Organization of
          our new Territories, with perhaps a compromise on the slavery question—this cannot pass.
          If Cass had been elected it would. Our Northern &amp; Western friends will not sacrifice
          themselves to sustain us, when we have refused to sustain them, and abandoned our own
          principles. The bills then, if past at the approaching Session will be sent to you with
          the W. proviso attached. You will of course use that great conservative power placed in
          your hands: the <hi rend="italics">Veto.</hi> This I desire to see, as the climax of your
          perfect Administration (except your favorable opinion of <name type="person">T.
            Benton</name>). The Whigs have made some capital out of your sanctioning the Oragon
          bill—this they have done for the want of information upon the part of our political
          friends; Where I have met them upon the stump or in conversation—I have placed it on this
          ground, “That the Teritory is a portion of our Louisiana purchase in <date when="1803">1803</date> or at least it was designated as Louisiana to 49. by <name type="place">France</name> &amp; <name type="place">England</name> in the Treaty of Utrecht; and the
          Missourie compromise act (in the same words of the Ordinance of 87 &amp; the Wilmot
          proviso) extended to all the Teritory N of 36. 30. (except Missourie) known as the La
          purchase. This question was then setled in <date when="1820">1820</date> by <name type="person">Mr. Clay</name>. It had been the Law since that time <pb/>(if
          constitutional) and repeating it in the Oregon bill did not change or alter the subsisting
          Law. If the proviso had been stricken out, the law, in all its bearings would have been
          the same then as there was no proposition to repeal the old Law and as it was only
          repeated in the new one. You had no excuse or pretext for withholding your sanction.
          Whereever I have used this argument your enemies have failed of a successful reply, and
          many have admited, that if I am correct in my premises, you are not to blame.</p>
        <p>The Whigs are to go into power, not upon principle, but by a deception practiced upon the
          people. I would say much more but I know you have not time to read. I hope to see you some
          day, when public duties will not press upon you, and we can talk over these things. I will
          only add that you could have carried this state by the usual democratic Majority.</p>

        <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
        <p>This is probably the last letter that I shall write to you, during my public life. The
          whigs here, are so completely intoxicated with their late extraordary success, (which by
          the by, is to me a matter of overwhelming distress) that in their proscriptions, they are
          even determind (as I have been informed to-day) to eject me, <hi rend="italics">from my
            office</hi>, almost one year, before it expires under the constitution. When Anderson
          visits Washington, he can explain my meaning. Unfortunately for them however, the same
          construction of the constitution, which ejects me, nullifies most of the acts of the first
          assembly; and cuts off one year, from <name type="person">Cabell</name>. But for this,
          they care nothing. For my part, I am disgusted with <name type="place">Florida</name>, and
          would be glad of an opportunity to leave it, (at least) temporarily. My successor, has not
          his equal in the thirty states of this Union. By the way, can’t you send me on a three
          months tour? It would be a salve, to my wounded feelings. I shall be certain not to
          accept; unless it is very<hi rend="italics"> profitable,</hi> and <hi rend="italics">the
            term, a very short one</hi>.</p>
        <p>But to the object of this letter—my most worthy and good friend <name type="person">Major
            Beard</name>, son of <name type="person">Lewis Beard</name>, the friend of your father,
          has a son, <pb/>
                    <name type="person">William Beard</name>, who is anxious to get the
          appointment of Cadet at Wt Point. Can’t you help him? <name type="person">Major
            Beard</name>, is my friend; and I feel proud of his friendship. He was once wealthy; but
          is now poor. He has a large family, and will probably be the next Democratic candidate for
          Govr in this state. By the way, if he had been at the last election, instead of <name type="person">Genl. Bailey</name>, we would not now be <hi rend="italics">disgraced</hi>, by having for our Govr., the present Whig Govr elect. <name type="person">Major Beard</name>, is at present, Register of public lands in this state, with a
          salary of $1000. He will be proscribed most certainly, and it will be truly unfortunate
          for him; for this is his only means of supports. <name type="person">William</name> his
          son, is now eighteen years old, a most exemplary young man, and entirely worthy of public
          confidence. His appointment would be highly satisfactory to his many friends in this
          state.</p>
        <p>I wrote to you, in relation to my own son, (<name type="person">William</name>) while he
          was in <name type="place">Mexico</name>.<note place="foot" n="1">

              16</date> and <date when="1847-07-17">17, 1847</date>.</note> He is now at home,
          appears to take no interest in anything, but militay matters. I understand that he behaved
          well in <name type="person">Mexico</name>. I do not know, that he wishes to leave home,
          unless he could be engaged, in active service. I suppose there is no vacancy in the army,
          and of course he cannot expect an appointment. He was a Liut of dragonos in the 3rd Regt.,
          and I believe served under your brother. I have a daughter in New York, who has been
          absent at school for six years. She will probably return this month, or next. I have
          directed her to come by Washington, only to see you. She will probably do so.</p>
        <p>
                    <pb/>In conclusion, I have written my message for the next assmbly, which meets on the
          4th Monday in this month. If the whigs allow me to send it to them, I will forward a copy
          to you. I am not ashamed of the sentiments therin expressed.</p>

        <salute>Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>Your controversy with <name type="person">Mr. Bass</name> in regard to the Grundy Avenue
          was brought to a close in the Chancery court to-day and I hasten to inform you of the
          result. The question was brought up by a petition in your name which was answered by <name type="person">Mr. Bass</name> for himself and the other <pb/>heirs—he denied that the
          avenue was embraced in the contract, insisted that <name type="person">Mr. Grundy</name>
          in his life time had dedicated it to the public as a public street and that his executors
          had not undertaken to convey the legal title but contended that all the title which
          remained in <name type="person">Mr. Grundy</name> should continue in his heirs. We took
          the depositions of Gov. <name type="person">A. V. Brown</name> and <name type="person">Judge Catron</name> both of whom proves that from all that <name type="person">Mr.
            Bass</name> said and did at the time of the sale and during the negotiation they
          understood him as selling and you as buying the avenue as much as the other grounds. No
          other proof was taken. <name type="person">Messrs. Fogg</name> and <name type="person">E.
            H. Ewing</name> argued the case elaborately for <name type="person">Mr.
            Bass</name>—<name type="person">Mr. Humphreys</name> and myself argued it for you. <name type="person">Mr. Fogg</name> took the ground that <name type="person">Mr. Grundy</name>
          in <date when="1831">1831</date> by a deed to <name type="person">W. H. Hunt</name>
          dedicated the 50 feet avenue as a public street—that by this dedication he divested
          himself of all title and therefore that there was no title in his heirs on which the
          Chancellor could make any decree. He rested his case mainly on this point and read the
          case in 6 Peters 431. to sustain it. I feared at one moment that he was making an
          impression on <name type="person">Judge Cahal. Mr. Ewing</name> took the same ground
          besides insisting very earnestly that the avenue was not embraced in the terms of the
          contract. Having the conclusion of the case I first took up <name type="person">Mr.
            Fogg</name>’s point and in answer to it cited 3 Kent 432. and cases referred to in the
          note—and then took up the case in 6 Peters relied on by <name type="person">Mr.
            Fogg</name> and showed that it was in fact an authority for us. Having established the
          position that the legal title to the avenue together with all other rights not
          inconsistent <pb/>with the rights of the public was in <name type="person">Mr.
            Grundy</name> I then announced to the Chancellor that I should next inquire to what
          extent this avenue had been dedicated to the public and what rights <name type="person">Mr. Grundy</name> had reserved in himself—that altho these were questions not involved
          in this case yet they were important to be looked at in order to show the value of this
          avenue to the premises purchased. Whilst I was discussing these points <name type="person">Judge Cahal</name> stopped me and remarked that I had said enough—that you were
          entitled to a decree for all the title which <name type="person">Mr. Grundy</name> had and
          as to any rights of the public in the avenue they could not be settled in this case—that
            <name type="person">Mr. Grundy</name> clearly had the legal title in the avenue and that
          together with all rights not given away to the public you were entitled under the contract
          to have decreed—he said he was satisfied that when the contract was made both sides
          understood the avenue as embraced in the terms thereof and that the objection now set up
          by <name type="person">Mr. Bass</name> was an after-thought, for which the executor must
          pay the costs. If you were not a lawyer I should not have troubled you with so much of the
          details, but as the case has to be again tried in the Supreme Court and as you may have
          leisure to make some suggestions I have thought it would be satisfactory to you to know
          the points on which the case has so far turned. I have prepared a decree in which the
          title is vested by mites and bounds according to the measurement of <name type="person">Mr. Nance</name>. I will send you a copy of the decree as soon as the Clerk enters it.
            <name type="person">Mr. Bass</name> takes an appeal—the other heirs have given no
          attention to the matter. It is my <pb/>understanding that you wish to exercise the right
          of controlling the avenue so as to beautify it and protect it from injury by a gate at
          Church street. I dont know that it<note place="foot" n="1">tk Leave space even if line
            breaks here.</note> be worth any thing to you but I give it any how as my opinion that
            <name type="person">Mr. Grundy</name> did nothing in the way of dedication, which will
          prevent you from carrying out your purposes. That question however can only arise when you
          undertake to execute your purpose—at present all we can have settled is the question of
          title and I congratulate you upon the succesful settlement of that. I shall send you a
          copy of the decree that you may make such suggestions as occur to you which I may use in
          drawing the decree in the Supreme Court in the event of our success there of which I see
          no reason to doubt.</p>

        <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
        <p>It has not been often, that matters connected with your appointing power have excited in
          me any particular interest, but the intelligence of the death of our accomplished friend
            <name type="person">Dr Martin</name> and the rumour <pb/>designating <name type="person">Mr Burke</name> as his successor at Rome forms an exception.</p>
        <p>Under existing circumstances, I fancy, that the appointment would be highly gratifying to
            <name type="person">Mr B.</name> who officially and with his pen unofficially has given
          to your noble Administration a support earnest, effective and untiring. It strikes me,
          that a nomination more satisfactory could hardly be made. Can it be confered upon a man
          more competent or more deserving? We of course should feel no little State pride in such a
          selection and perhaps you may deem our present attitude one, in connexion with the eminent
          qualifications of the individual, not unworthy ofsuch a compliment. I would not certainly
          desire to interfere with your purposes, tho’ I shall feel truly gratified if the rumour
          prove well founded.</p>
        <p>Please to present my kindest regards to <name type="person">Mrs Polk</name> and believe
          me ever . . . .</p>

        <salute>Respected Sir</salute>
        <p>I feele assured that your Excellency will pardon this intrusion <pb/>upon your time and
          upon your known kindness. I am Sir the more encouraged from the fact, that I am about to
          pleade for forgiveness at the Hands of your Kind Lady, through you.</p>
        <p>She has been in this City for sevral days, and I admit that she had a perfect right to
          expect all the attention from <name type="person">Mrs B</name> and my self that we could
          pay her. If it appears that we have not done so, by doing which we should I assure have
          been the most pleased party; I beg to be heard. When <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mrs P</name>
                    </hi> arived <name type="person">Mrs B.</name> was much
          unwell, but as soon as she was able to go out, we calld and left our <hi rend="italics">Card</hi>, <name type="person">Mrs P.</name> being out. I after wards calld alone, and
          was informed (as I under stood it) that she had left. Judge then Sir my surprise &amp;
          mortification this morning on learning that she had yesterday paid a visit to my favorite
          Ship, the <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="place">Washington</name>
                    </hi>, &amp; I not
          present; believe, me<note place="foot" n="1">Brownell probably meant to place “me,” which
            he inserted with a caret, before the comma.</note> Sir it was so greate that I cannot
          find words to express my mortification, and permit me Sir to ask that you will be pleased
          to so inform <name type="person">Mrs P</name>. Your friend would not be guilty of any such
          want of Attention to those, from whom he has received such marked attention, and his
          appoligy for thus addresing your Excellency must be, that he is unwilling to rest under
          any such imputation with out explanation, and he feels assured that in your heart he will
          find a ready response, and in the fair Ladys a forgiveness.</p>
        <p>Again Sir you are undoubtly aware that there are dificulties with <hi rend="italics">Contractors</hi>, in carrying Out the Contract, in building the Steam Ships which you
          Honored me with the Superintendance; they the <hi rend="italics">Directors</hi>
          <pb/>have had meeteings daily, to derive ways &amp; means to carry forward this greate
          measure. This has been the Case for the last 10 days. This state of things has nessarilly
          occupied much of my time, in the hope of giving a helping hand towards the consummation of
          this greate national measure.</p>
        <p>I am Sir with the hope, that this explanation which I felt was do, to you and your Lady,
          that I shall stand excused . . . .</p>

        <p>
                    <name type="person">Mr Fort</name> who took your Boy home has returned home. He got <hi rend="italics">Addison</hi> home safe and found all well at your place with the exeption
          of <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Maria</name>
                    </hi> &amp; one other women and thy
          were not considered Dangerous. I had <hi rend="italics">Addison</hi> as Ironed and chained
          every Night. The Overseer was very moderate with him. He corrected him but not bad. <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Fort</name>
                    </hi> you know is a Near Neighbour ad
          you may depend on him. He thinks you have a first rate Man your Overseer. You have plenty
          of old corn and plenty of Meat and it is he says a Superiour Season; I was ressently calld
          to <hi rend="italics">Dyers Burg</hi>
          <pb/>the day before <name type="person">Mr Fort</name> started as James is <hi rend="italics">in Arkansas—</hi>and directed <name type="person">Mr Stills</name> my
          overseer to send <hi rend="italics">Addison</hi> to Dancivill with my waggon in order to
          secure him thare at the Shop—and directed my Overseer to take the <hi rend="italics">Mewl</hi> I got you on to <hi rend="italics">Dancyvill</hi> for him to ride and directd
          him to take it his self. Contrary to my orders he put a Boy of mine on the Mewl. The Boy
          was sixteen years old. He mounted the Mewl ad whipped him at my Door ad the Mewl never
          stoppd until he thrw my Boy against the Stable and he was killd for a while and is still
          seriously injured ribs Broke—<name type="person">Dr. Haywoods</name> thinks in time he may
          recover. I think it doubtful. He spits Blood. Well to the point they in my absence thought
          it best to leave the Mewl I got for you and took one of my Mewls bought at the same time
          and the same price. I was satisfied that they done so for your Boy Ironed might of got
          hurt. The Mewl they took is equally as good a one but not quite so Large. I purchased them
          alltogether and my Neighbors got out of the same Drove at the same price. Your Buisness
            <name type="person">Mr Fort</name> says is going on well. I was satisfied of the fact
          after you wrote me
          and I shewed Addison no [Faving]<note place="foot" n="2">Word uncertain; Caldwell may have meant to write "Favoring."</note> nor did
          I allow him after your letter to ever speak to me. <name type="person">Mr Fort</name> says
          he will never try it again.</p>
        <p>I furnished him with good woollen Suit of cloathes good shoes and socks Hat Blanket as he
          had been sick. He lookd very well and stood the trip well. <name type="person">Mr
            Fort</name> said the Mewl never even lookd tired and all got down well. <name type="person">Mr Fort</name> charged one Dollar per Day and I found him. I have paid him
          all and I expect to go to Memphis tomorrow and will do as you <pb/>directed see <name type="person">S. P. Walker</name> and he will arainge it with me.</p>
        <p>
                    <name type="person">Dr. Haywood</name> Made no charge for attending Addison. It is a
          Nephew of the one you know but he had been at your farm with Jim and did not charge you a
          cent so I am particalar to tell you all.</p>
        <p>I have 30. Bales of to Day on the Natchez and will make thirty more; <hi rend="italics">500 a Bale</hi> cotton is very low indeed I cant make it at the present prices. I think

          state, that I had no communication whatever with you after your election, except your
          letter inviting me to be a member of your cabinet,<note place="foot" n="1">
                        <name type="person">Polk</name> to <name type="person">Marcy</name>, <date when="1848-03-01">March 1, 1845</date>.</note> until my arrival in Washington on the <date when="1845-03-05">5th of March 1845</date>.</p>
        <p>I do not recollect of having had any conversation with you in regard to the annexation of
          Texas—and as to the mode of doing it under the resolutions which had been recently adopted
          by Congress, I am sure I had none, until the subject was brought up at the first full
          meeting of your cabinet which was held, as I believe, on the <date when="--03-10">10th of
            March</date>. On that occasion you first submitted the matter to our consideration
          without any indication of your own preference for either of the modes contemplated by the
          resolutions.</p>
        <p>The action of your predecessor on the subject was then made known and the despatch which
          had then been sent off was read. The question was thereupon raised, whether the selection
          of mode made by him was not conclusive; but as, it appeared to be the opinion of each
          member of your cabinet that the mode which had been already selected was preferable to the
          other alternative, and as such also appeared to be your own opinion, that question was not
          expressly decided. It was determined to confirm and carry out the proceedings which had
          been commenced by the previous administration.</p>
        <p>Neither to your cabinet, to others or to myself did I ever hear you say or intimate that
          you were embarrassed by any opinions previously <pb/>expressed on the subject, or that you
          had ever done or said any thing to any person whatever which did not leave you perfectly
          free to choose either alternative presented by the resolutions of Congress, nor did I ever
          hear until the appearance of the publications referred to in your letter that you had ever
          said any thing to justify an expectation in any quarter that you would select the
          alternative in what has been called the Senate’s branch of the resolutions.</p>

        <salute>Sir,</salute>

            letters herein.</note>
                </p>
        <p>
                    <pb/>Congress at its last session made large appriations for public works within the
          limits of this City, providing that the several sums appropriated should be expended under
          the direction of the Commissioner of Public Buildings; and in reference to neither of them
          was he subjected to the control of any person as to <hi rend="italics">the</hi> plans or
          estimates for the contemplated works, but the whole discretion as well as the whole
          responsibility of the expendature, was, by the act of appropration, made to rest on
          him.</p>
        <p>Even before the appropriation bill had received the final action of Congress, I found
          myself surrounded by hungry expectants, who were eagerly watching its progress,
          determined, if possible, to make its provisions, more beneficial to themselves, than I,
          impressed with my official obligations, could permit them to be made. These persons from
          the moment of their disappointment became, as I had reason to suppose they would, my
          personal enemies.</p>
        <p>The two petitions, dated <date when="--09-09">September 9th</date>, are undoubtedly the
          bitter fruits of the hostility of these persons, and were intended to prevent me from
          pursuing a course which I believed to be most promotive of the public weal, by raising a
          clamor against me in regard to the manner of executing the work on the Indiana Avenue.
          Most of the signers of these papers are unknown to me, and must, consequently, be
          incompetent to judge of my qualifications for the duties of my office.</p>
        <p>These petitions, after alleging my incapacity, ask my removal solely <pb/>on the ground
          that the interests of the Corporation of Washington and its citizens are deeply effected
          by my acts. Now, Sir, I have on the subject of these petitions only to report, that so far
          from having incurred the censure of the Corporation of Washington by my acts in the work
          referred to, I had the satisfaction to meet the cordial approbation of that body; and so
          well convinced were the getters up of these petitions of this fact, that the papers were
          held to await a more favorable opportunity for attack. This opportunity they suppose has
          now occurred, and the petitions, though prepared on another occasion, and upon a different
          ground of complaint, are used to strengthen and support charges brought against me by the
            <name type="org">Washington Gas Light Company</name>, or persons in its interest,
          evidently with the intention of deterring me from the faithful performance of my duty in
          relation to the unrighteous conduct of that Company.</p>
        <p>Congress having made an appropriation for lighting the Capitol grounds, <name type="place">Pennsylvania Avenue</name>, and the President’s House with gas, I took the
          earliest means, after the passage of the bill, to inform myself fully, by communications
          personal and written with the best informed practical and scientific men in the United
          States connected with gas works, as to the best manner of accomplishing the object. I then
          entered into a contract with the <name type="org">Washington Gas Light Company</name>,
          hoping at the time that it would, for its own credit and ultimate advantage, cause the
          work to be executed both skilfully and faithfully, in accordance with <pb/>estimates
          prepared by <name type="person">Mr Charles Roome</name>, Superintendent and Engineer of
          the <name type="org">Manhattan Gas Works</name>, <name type="place">New York</name>, and
            <name type="person">Mr Robert</name> Cornelius of Philadelphia, both of whom are
          thoroughly acquainted with the business.</p>
        <p>I am sorry to inform you that I have had occasion deeply to regret the making of this
          contract, as its terms, meaning and intent, have, in my opinion, been violated by the
          Agents of the Company in several particulars, but especially in the laying of the pipes in
          a very imperfect and unfaithful manner, that the Company might make an undue profit from
          their contract.</p>
        <p>Believing that the joints of the pipes were badly made, I felt myself in duty bound, as
          the work progressed, to have them subjected to a test by means of an air pump, and could
          obtain no higher pressure than four inches of mercury, while in the opinion of Professor
          Henry twelve or fifteen inches should have been reached, Eighteen or twenty in the opinion
          of Professor Cresson, Superintendent of the Philadelphia Gas Works, and at least fifteen
          inches in the opinion of <name type="person">Mr Roome</name>, Superintendent of the <name type="org">Manhattan Gas works</name>, <name type="place">New York</name>.</p>
        <p>Under these unfavorable circumstances, with the joints of the pipes not air tight and
          consequently not gas tight, I resolved to protect the public interests committed to my
          charge at whatever cost of slander and abuse to myself. I therefore determined to advance
          to the gas Company no more money than would be sufficient to pay for the pipes delivered
          in <name type="place">Washington</name>, believing that the half-done work upon those
          <pb/>which have been laid is worse than useless, as it leaves them in a leaky
          condition.</p>
        <p>This refusal on my part, to sanction, by the payment of such sums of public money as were
          desirable to the gas Company, a gross violation of their contract, has subjected me to the
          charge of incompetency by the agents of this Company, and those who have united with them
          in their unrighteous vocation. To this sweeping charge, which contains no specifications,
          I can only reply that of the several works placed under my direction by the act of
          Congress, all but one have been prosecuted thus far in a manner, both as respects economy
          and quality of work, that will, in my humble opinion, meet the approbation, and, perhaps,
          receive the commendations, of those capable of judging correctly in relation to such
          matters. The one exception is the gas lighting, and in this it is true there has been both
          unnecessary delay and unfaithfulness: whether these have grown out of the <hi rend="italics">incompetency</hi> of the Commissioner of Public Buildings, I respectfully
          submit upon the foregoing statement.</p>
        <p>Among the papers referred to me, I find a letter, without date, from <name type="person">Mr James Crutchett</name>. It was my fortune to incur the implacable enmity of this
          individual, soon after I entered on the duties of my office, by opposing the erection of
          the long pole on the dome of the Capitol. Of his letter I have briefly to say, that all
          the statements which it contains as to my having contracted for fixtures of an “improper”
          weight and description, and having “interposed” difficulties, calculated to prevent the
          <pb/>execution of these works until a late period of the ensuing year,”<note place="foot" n="2">Opening quotation mark missing.</note> are, to say the least of them, wide from
          the truth. I have made no contract, and have proposed to make none in connection with gas
          lighting, except as herein-before stated; and so far from having interposed any obstacle
          to the execution of the work, I have endeavoured to hasten it by every means in my
          power.</p>
        <p>
                    <name type="person">Mr Bigelow</name>, the personage who figures on the same sheet with
            <name type="person">Mr Crutchett</name>, is an active and very influential office-holder
          in the <name type="org">Washington Gas Light Company</name>, which has hitherto been so
          unfaithful in the performance of the contract made with the Commissioner of Public
          Buildings. This individual, who seems to be far more avaricious than wise, and who, when
          in the hot pursuit of gain, evidently rushes onward regardless of consequences, very
          modestly pronounces upon my utter incompetency, but specifies no instance of incompetency,
          or in which “he daily wastes the public monies.” Had I permitted <name type="person">Mr
            Bigelow</name> and his coadjutors to pocket the “public monies” in the way they desired,
          not a word would have been written by him respecting my incompetency or wastefulness. I
          should undoubtedly have secured not only his friendship, but also received from him the
          highest commendations for my frugality in expending the “public monies,” and consummate
          wisdom and ability in the performance of my official duties. But this I have not done, and
          therefore I am subjected to his vituperation and abuse.</p>
        <p>It only remains to notice the letter of <name type="person">Mr Cluskey</name>. This
          individual <pb/>who has “his private grief,” which can be readily and directly traced to
          the long pole, recently taken from the dome of the Capitol. A short time prior to the
          removal of that monstrocity, as <name type="person">Mr Webster</name> termed it, <name type="person">Mr Cluskey</name> requested from me the Superintendence of its removal. I
          granted his request, with the understanding that <name type="person">Mr Waters</name>,
          Boatswain of the Navy Yard at Washington, with such seamen as he should select, should
          arrange and manage the ropes required in taking it down. A short time prior to its
          removal, <name type="person">Mr Cluskey</name> again called upon me, and wished me to
          inform him when he should commence the work. Without delay was my reply, provided <name type="person">Mr Waters</name> and his seamen manage the ropes. To this proviso he
          objected, saying that he must have the sole control, if any, of the undertaking. I replied
          that <name type="person">Mr Waters</name> would not be controlled in the performance of
          his duty, but that a good understanding could be effected between them without difficulty,
          and proposed that he should confer with <name type="person">Mr Waters</name> on the
          subject. To this proposition he objected with much warmth of feeling, and immediately left
          me. Since then our personal intercourse has ceased, and <name type="person">Mr
            Cluskey</name> has become my enemy.</p>
        <p>His letter contains but two or three statements which I deem it proper to notice. He
          alleges that the brick culverts that cross <name type="place">Pennsylvania Avenue</name>
          have been injured in laying gas pipes. This I am confident is true, but the injury was
          done by the Gas Company without my authority or knowledge, and the moment I became aware
          of what had been done, I called the attention of the Mayor of the City to the fact. <name type="person">Mr <pb/>Cluskey</name> further states that the pipes are “placed at an
          unnecessary depth below the surface.” By the terms of the contract between myself and the
          Gas Company, the pipes are to be laid in trenches two feet deep, which is one foot less
          than the uniform depth at which they are laid in <name type="place">New York</name>, and
          is believed to be the least at which a uniform temperature can be reached. A large number
          of pipes in Penn. Avenue, I am satisfied, are laid in trenches less than eighteen inches
          deep, and were placed in the ground and the trenches filled up, without my knowledge or
          consent, and before the contract was signed.</p>
        <p>The regret of <name type="person">Mr Cluskey</name> that there is “not an Engineer
          attached to the civil” department of the Government is not to be wondered at, as he is
          undoubtedly very desirous to have such a place made for his particular accommodation, and
          will spare no exertions to accomplish his object.</p>
        <p>I am happy to state, <name type="person">Mr Cluskey</name>’s opinion to the contrary
          notwithstanding, that the lamp posts, which he avers “are totally unfit for the purpose
          and out of character,” were highly approved of by <name type="person">Mr Cornelius</name>,
          and are required in the Specification to the Contract between the Gas Company and myself,
          prepared and penned by <name type="person">Mr Roome</name>, to be “placed along the Avenue
          and around the Capitol grounds at such points as the Commissioner shall direct.”</p>
        <p>But I forbear to enlarge on this unpleasant subject, and take leave, most respectfully,
          to solicit your attention to the accompanying letters, <pb/>marked Nos 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6.

        <salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>I received this morning your letter of the 21st Instant.<note place="foot" n="1">Letter
            not found.</note> More than a <pb/>week before the date of your letter, I wrote to you,
          &amp; informed you, that I would appoint your son, charge d’ affaires to Rome.<note place="foot" n="2">
                        <name type="person">Polk</name> to <name type="person">Cass</name>,
              <date when="1848-11-14">November 14, 1848</date>.</note> As my letter bore my frank
          and you make no mention of having received it, I fear it may have fallen under the
          espionage of some unprincipled person as it passed through the Post office. As it related
          to other matters, besides your son’s appointment, I will thank you to inform me whether it
          reached you. If it did not, it is certain, that it has been purloined from the Post
          office. In that letter I left it to your decision whether I should appoint your son,
          before or after the meeting of the Senate. It is now so near the time of the meeting of
          that body, that it will probably be best to postpone the appointment, and send the
          Nomination to the Senate, during the first week of the Session.</p>
        <p>I am glad to learn from you, that it is possible you may accept a re-election to the
          Senate and be in Washington this winter. My opinion is, that under the circumstances of
          your position, you ought not to hesitate, to accept an election to the Senate. The whole
          Democratic party I am sure would be highly gratified to see you, again a member of that
          body, where you would have the opportunity as you have heretofore so ably done, to
          vindicate and maintain the measures of the Democratic policy, upon the success of which, I
          am thorroughly satisfied the enduring prosperity of the country must depend. Your friends
          every where would be pleased to see you restored by the voluntary choice of your State, to
          a theatre, upon which you could by your acts, put to shame, some of the <pb/>vile assaults
          which were made upon you, in the late political canvass by the Federal opposition.</p>
        <p>Though greatly disappointed, &amp; deeply regretting that I cannot at the close of my
          term, surrender the Government into your hands, yet as the decision which has been made
          cannot be reversed, it will give me personal pleasure, to meet you again in Washington,
          and in your former position. Hoping soon to do so: . . . .</p>

        <salute>Dear Sir!</salute>
        <p>The Planters Bank, this day sold at public auction the Store house formerly owned by
            <name type="person">Mr S Walker</name>, for fourteen hundred dollars. It was purchased
          by <name type="person">Robert O. Potter</name>, Circuit Court Clerk of <name type="place">Maury County</name>, who desires to buy your store house and lot ajoining it, and
          requested me to write you and know if you wished to sell, and if so, to ascertain your
          price and terms. The Bank sold the Walker Store House on a credit of one, two, &amp; three
          years, and he mentioned that he would desire the <pb/>same time should he purchase your
          property.</p>
        <p>If you desire to sell, you can write to <name type="person">Robert Campbell</name>, or in
          his absence to his son <name type="person">John Campbell</name>, who will I doubt not take
          pleasure in attending to the sale for you. I think it is the only chance you will have to
          make an advantageous sale.</p>
        <p>My movements are uncertain, I am alive to any adventure which promises honor or proffit—I
          think of visiting Little Rock Arkansas and judge of its advantages as a perminent
          location. I have abandoned all idea of settling at Memphis—first because in a buisness
          point of view it is now crowded to suffocation, and in any other light affording no
          flattering inducements. At <name type="place">Columbia</name> I can make a good living,
          but other considerations render it unpleasant as a residence—politically I might succeed,
          but the squabbles and conflict would be long and violent, for aspirants for Congress in
          this District, live in every hedge—and are fully versed in all the insidious tricks of the
            <hi rend="italics">hedge hog</hi>—that is work under-ground. I believe, if I would throw
          myself into the contest—I could succeed—indeed I have every inducement to do so—with the
          most flattering prospects of success; but am restrained by an inclination to opperate on a
          new theatre, in some new Country.</p>
        <p>Mother and my Wife are well. Nothing new. My love to <name type="person">Sister

        <p>Tho I presume my last letter<note place="foot" n="1">Letter not found.</note> has reached
          you long ere this, yet for fear it has not, I think it best to acknowledge the receipt of

        <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
        <p>I have read attentively your message to both houses of Congress and as a general thing
          concur with you in sentiment.</p>
        <p>You speak well of our Union. It is a <hi rend="italics">glorious union</hi> indeed! and
          would continue a glorious union were it not for a certain vexed question. Does not the
          evil become greater the more it is extended?</p>
        <p>You understand the history of the formation of this goverment and must know that it was
          the expectation of such men as <name type="person">Jefferson Madison</name> &amp; others
          that slavery would be confined to the states where it then existed. You know that it was
          actually excluded by the ordinance of 87 from all the then teritory of the <name type="place">United States</name>.</p>
        <p>
                    <pb/>Had it not been for the evil genius of <name type="person">Henry Clay</name> there
          would never have been the <name type="place">Missouri</name> Compromise. It was the
          expectation of the founders of our government that slavery would not increase but would
          gradually diminish.</p>
        <p>
                    <name type="person">Thomas Jefferson</name> said that the fathers who had fought the
          battles of the revolution when they had achieved our liberty felt as though they might
          retire and allow their sons, who had sucked at the paps of liberty, to carry out the
          principles of liberty. But alas he says our sons went to sleep and the dark spirit of
          slavery instead of being annihilated increased upon us. I give this sentiment of <name type="person">Jeffersons</name> from reccollection. The fathers knew that slavery was
          opposd to the principles which they were wishing to establish, and they simply allowed it
          to remain temporarily supposing it would gradually be abolished in the states one by one
          until slavery would cease to exist. Now we all know that if the union is ever dissolved it
          will be in consequence of Slavery. Is the existence &amp; extention of slavery of more
          consequence than the Union?</p>
        <p>My Dear Sir You can render your name immortal. Come out for the Wilmot Proviso sign the
          bill and Posterity will rank your name with that of <name type="person">Jefferson</name>.</p>
        <p>Let the Wilmot Proviso be now passed and the danger is over. We shall have no more slave
          teritory &amp; the Union will be preserved.</p>
        <p>The philanthropists of the world look upon this subject with intense intrest. They look
          upon this as the turning point with us. The <pb/>enemies of our union desire to see
          slavery extended. They see in it the worm gnawing at our vitals. Who will be injured by
          the passage of the Wilmot proviso? Provided it should become slave teritory the northern
          man will have as good a right to buy slaves &amp; take them there as a southerner. And
          provided it should continue free teritory The southerner will have as good a right to go
          there as the northern man. The idea that the slaveholder has any exclusive rights to that
          teritory is not philosophical.</p>
        <p>Does not sectional interest or self interest have more to do in this matter than <hi rend="italics">principle</hi>?</p>
        <p>It is in your power, Honored Sir, to do your co[untry]<note place="foot" n="2">Letters
            missing, tear.</note> a great good and yourself lasting honor.</p>
        <p>Let pure democratic principle influence you. Slavery is the opposite of democracy. We as
          a nation simply have the <hi rend="italics">name</hi> not the <hi rend="italics">reality</hi>. O! that we were consistent! I am proud of my nation but O,! how it
          humbles me to think of the foul spot upon our escutcheon. If slavery can not be abolished
          where it now exists I pray that it may not be extended. Hoping that you may be influenced
          upon this subject by great broad &amp; philanthropic motives—I subscribe myself . . . .</p>

        <p>I have entended writing you ever since my return &amp; have frequently sat down for the
          purpose, and would get the commencment written, then there would be a stop. News; News; I
          would run up, &amp; down, the <pb/>vocabulary of news, &amp; scandals of our Village, and
          find that I had written so very frequently to <name type="place">Virginia</name>, that
          there was nothing left worth communicating, to <hi rend="italics">your</hi> Ladyship.
          Think’s <hi rend="italics">I</hi> to myself I <hi rend="italics">will not</hi> write to my
            <hi rend="italics">daughter</hi> for a considerable time, &amp; collect a very large
          budget of writing material for a letter for my Sister, &amp; send by way of mail, <hi rend="italics">but I</hi> am very sorry to say those <hi rend="italics">good</hi>
          resolutions like all others passed from my mind, &amp; I was so completely absorbed in
          driving Dull Care away by writing to Virginia, who occupied the most of my thoughts, that
          I failed to do my duty. Now that I have grown <hi rend="italics">somewhat</hi>
                    <note place="foot" n="2">Hays emphasizes “somewhat” with a dotted underline. In all other
            instances, italics represent a solid underline.</note> accustomed to the separation I
          think I shall write you as frequently as you could desire, (ie) if my letters are deemg
          worthy of a reply.</p>
        <p>
                    <name type="person">Dr. Hays</name> &amp; I very frequently speak of your and my
          brother’s great kindness to our dear daughter, &amp; feel exceedingly grateful to you
          both. <name type="person">Jeannie</name> very rarely writes without mentioning your
          delight in contributing to, her &amp; <name type="person">Sallie</name>’s happiness, &amp;
          that their slightest wishes are cheerfully gratified by you, &amp; her Uncle. The
          separation from home she bears much better than was expected. <hi rend="italics">That</hi>
          we attribute to her situation being rendered happy by her “Mate” (Sallie). They seem
          through divine providence to be the cementing branches of the two families. My greatest
          wish is for <hi rend="italics">time</hi> speedily to roll on &amp; <name type="person">Jeannie</name> return, &amp; in due time have a visit from <name type="person">Sallie</name>, &amp; then <hi rend="italics">how</hi> I will strive to make them enjoy
          themselves.</p>
        <p>Brother <name type="person">William</name> thinks of going to <name type="place">Little
            Rock, Arkansas</name>. He wrote <pb/>to an acquaintance there as to the prospect for a
          Lawyer or politician. His reply was favorable to his [setling]<note place="foot" n="3">Here and below the bracketed word may, alternately, be “setting.”</note> there. His
          wife has the traveling mania, thinks of [setling] no where. He could do splendedly if he
            <hi rend="italics">would here</hi>, or elswhere. He has been received by the citizens of
          this place with great hospitality. Likewise sister mary, she professes to like this place

          would probably rebound to her benifit. She seems willing to go to Little Rock, but it is

        <salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>I have received your letter of the 5th Inst. acknowledging the receipt of mine of the
          26th Ultimo, and am glad to learn that my previous letter<note place="foot" n="1">
                        <name type="person">Polk</name> to <name type="person">Cass</name>, <date when="1848-11-14">November 14, 1848</date>.</note> had been received by you. I nominated your son to
          the Senate some days ago, as charge d’ affaires to the Papal States.</p>
        <p>Great diversity opinion, I learn, prevails in Congress in regard to what action shall be
          had upon the territorial question. The first impression of many Democratic members was, to
          do nothing at the present session, and leave the question to be managed by <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Genl. Taylor</name>
                    </hi>. This was the first &amp;
          perhaps a natural impulse, but is I think giving way to calmer reflection. My strong
          apprehension is, that if no Government bee provided for <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="place">California</name>
                    </hi>, at the present session, there is imminent danger
          that, that rich and fine country may be lost to the Union. Attracted by its mineral wealth
          &amp; commercial advantages, the emigration to it, will probably be rapid without example,
          and I should not be surprised, if before the end of August, there were an hundred, perhaps
          an hundred and fifty thousand people there. They will be in a state of anarchy, and
          without Government of law. Among them will probably be <pb/>men of enterprise of energy,
          and of adventure; men of talent, of ambition and of capital. In this condition, of things,
          if Congress shall do nothing at the present session, they may, and in all probability
          will, organize an Independent Government, calling it, the <hi rend="italics">California or
            Pacific Republic</hi>, and may endeavour to induce <hi rend="italics">Oregon</hi> to
          join them. Should this occur, of which there is great danger, and should this be their
          condition, when Congress shall meet next December, I fear that the Federal party, in order
          to relieve <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Genl. Taylor</name>
                    </hi>, from the
          embarrassment in which he is placed on the <hi rend="italics">Wilmot Proviso</hi>, may be
          willing, and some of them, even desire to give up the country. There is serious ground to
          fear such a result. We know that the Federal party have always been opposed to the
          extension of our limits. They were opposed to the acquisition of <name type="place">Louisiana</name>, of <name type="place">Florida</name>, of <name type="place">Texas</name>, and more recently we know that they were opposed to accepting any
          territorial indemnity from <name type="place">Mexico</name>. These are my apprehensions. I
          have so expressed them to several of my frinds, and have said to them, that though, <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Genl. Taylor</name>
                    </hi>’s administration might be
          embarrassed, by having the question open, we should remember that “We have a country to
          serve as well as a party to obey,” and that it was in my judgement our solemn duty to
          provide governments for the new territories at the present Session. I hope this is now
          becoming the prevailing opinion, but in what manner governments are to be provided is the
          question of greatest difficulty. The opinion prevails with many, that neither of the
          propositions of the last session, can be carried, without <pb/>being clogged and
          embarrassed with the <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Wilmot Proviso</name>
                    </hi>.
          You will have seen my recommendations in my message. As an original question the
          non-interference doctrine, as laid down in your <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Nicholson</name>
                    </hi> letter, is unquestionably the true doctrine. Either of the
          others I was willing &amp; am still so, to take as a <hi rend="italics">compromise</hi>.
          If it is attempted to extend the <hi rend="italics">Wilmot Proviso restriction</hi> South
          of 36°. 30"., it would produce a flow of excitment, dividing the country by
          geographical lines, <pb/>that I verily believe would shake and endanger the Union. To
          avoid that dangerous question <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Senator
              Douglass</name>
                    </hi> has introduced a Bill to erect the acquired territory at once
          into a State. I have heard objections urged to this plan, though I think it is gaining
          strength. What the result will be, it is impossible to foresee. <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr. Douglass</name>
                    </hi>’s Bill requires modification. If it be
          confined, to the erection of a state embracing <hi rend="italics">California</hi> alone,
          and with some other modifications, postponing action in relation to the remainder of the
          territory for the present, it is possible it may pass, and the <hi rend="italics">Proviso</hi> difficulty be avoided at least for the present. God grant that our
          beloveed country may have a safe deliverance, from this delicate &amp; most dangerous
          question.</p>
        <p>In my letter of the 26th ultimo, in answer to an intimation from you, that you might be
          returned to the Senate,<note place="foot" n="2">
                        <name type="person">Cass</name>’s letter
            not found.</note> I expressed the gratification it would afford me to see you again on
          the theater on which you have rendered so much valuable service to the country. It is due
          in the frankness which one friend should always observe towards another, that I should
          now, say, that I did not then see the <hi rend="italics">fearful difficulties</hi> which
          are likely to arise upon the territorial question. You are committed to the opinions
          expressed in the <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Nicholson</name>
                    </hi> letter, and
          I have no doubt would maintain these opinions in your action, if you were in the Senate of
          the <name type="place">United States</name>. One of your best frinds in the Senate,
          (without any intimation from me, that I had had any correspondence with you in relation to
          your return to the Senate) mentioned to me a day or two ago, that it was said in the City,
          you would come back to the Senate, and that some Whigs had remarked to him, that you would
          come to the Senate, and that you would be <hi rend="italics">instructed </hi>by your
          Legislature to vote for the <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Wilmot
            Proviso</name>
                    </hi>. In that event he said you would be compelled either to <hi rend="italics">obey</hi> or <hi rend="italics">resign</hi>. To <hi rend="italics">obey</hi> would be impossible, without revoking the constitutional opinions expressed
          in the <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Nicholson</name>
                    </hi> letter. Your political
          opponents calculate that you would be placed in this dilemma, and that take what course
          you might, your political destruction, they would calculate, would be certain. If you
          obeyed you would utterly ruin yourself throughout the whole South, if not throughout the
          Union, because that would be a departure from the ground on which you were supported by
          the Democratic party in the late election. If you either <hi rend="italics">disobeyed</hi>
          <hi rend="italics">instructions</hi> or <hi rend="italics">resigned</hi>, you would make
          an issue with your own State. After what I had written to you, I deemed it my duty to
          submit these views to you. If you can come to the Senate <hi rend="italics">uninstructed</hi>, you would have no embarrassment, could render essential service to
          the Democratic <pb/>party, and under such circumstances I repeat I should be most happy to
          see you there. But if <hi rend="italics">instructed</hi>, upon this vital question, your
          position, would be such, that you would be compelled, to adhere to the doctrines of the
            <hi rend="italics">Nicholson</hi> letter, and thereby disobey, or you must <hi rend="italics">resign</hi>.</p>
        <p>I have written a long letter, but in great haste, and subject to half a dozen
          interruptions by calls. I have not time to revise or condense it. I can only add that I
          know you will properly appreciate the friendly motive, which has induced me to write
          it.</p>

        <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
        <p>I have read your Message. The begining of your administration was good; the Close is
          still better; you &amp; your Cabinet members will recieve the plaudits of a grateful
          Country. The election of <name type="person">Genl Taylor</name> will induce the <hi rend="italics">House</hi> to postpone the organization of territorial governments in
            <name type="place">California</name> &amp; <name type="place">New Mexico</name>, that he
          may select the governor &amp;c. If I am mistaken in this, I am still willing &amp;
          solicitous to receive the appointment <pb/>from you, as I wish to tame the comanches. My
          peculiar situation induces me to say to you, as I did last session, that I will receive
          from you any other office foreign or domestice; The law for my relief appropriated
          10.000$; but authorises the sec of war to have the buildings furnished by me, at my Cost,
          for the choctaw academy valued, &amp; pay the valuation—which has been made &amp; returned
          to him 16.000$ which gives me a legal Claim upon my Country for 6000$ over the 10.000$. I
          have requested the sec of war to Consult you &amp; if you approve, to recommend to the
          comtees on Indian affairs or ways &amp; means to appropriate the 6000$ under that law to
          enable him to pay me the 6000$. Such men as <name type="person">J. J. Crittenden</name>
          give me the opinion, that the 6000$ is a legal Claim, upon my Country; &amp; if the sec of
          war would take this Course there would be very little if any difficulty.</p>
        <p>My dear friend, this 6000$ would enable me to pay my remaining liabilities &amp; then I
          could live only in independant poverty, but I should feel as a man &amp; live in honor.
          Without this 6000$ I am totally ruined, &amp; perhaps ruin your good friend Sevier, who is
          my security, to that amount. I have sacrificed a very large estate &amp; have so reduced
          my debts that this 6000$ would pay so that I could save myself. I expect to be in the City
          during the session. If a few Selfish men of our party had not forced me from runing for
          Governor of this State, I could have been elected &amp; that would have elected Cass.

          it seems is 60, and at this rate, you will reach before your first year expires, the
          maximum, for which it will become necessary to dismiss you. You can have no good excuse

            and below cut off side of page.</note> and will still do so if you prove yourself t[o]
          be worthy of it. If however you choose to disregard my wishes &amp; admonitions, and to
          neglect your duty, you must rely upon yourself and not on me, in future life. Yo[u] may
          think me too strict, but in this you are mistaken. I know it is, in your power by
          <pb/>ordinary attention to your duty, to erase the mortifying Reports, of your conduct
          whi[ch] have been made for <hi rend="italics">October</hi> and <hi rend="italics">November</hi>. For the future I hope to receive no more such Reports. I have great
          anxiety to have the result of your examination “<hi rend="italics">in studies</hi>” in
          January. It generally happens that those w[ho] have most Demerit marks, stand the wo[rst]
          examination. I hope in your case, it may be otherwise. You should devote every moment of
          your time to your studies to the end that you may pass as reputab[le] an examination as
          possible. I hope f[or] the best, but a few weeks will determine what your standing in your
          class is. I write you thus plainly for your good [. . .] hope you may profit by it. Your
          future standing and reputation will depend upon your own conduct, at the Academy.</p>
        <p>I write this letter with pain. It would give me sincere pleasure, if I could write one of
          a different character commending you for your good conduct. With the Reports for <hi rend="italics">October</hi> and <hi rend="italics">November</hi> before me, this I
          cannot do.</p>
        <p>Your affectionate Uncle</p>

        <p>I have to say that I am a practical Geologist and Mineralogist and pretty well acquainted
          with the Mural hills am about fifty years of age, a <pb/>Physician, of a Strong
          constitution and can endure as much hardship as any other man. I have examined the reports
          from the Gold region of California and have friends there in the business, and think of
          taking a trip myself to <name type="place">California</name>. From all I can learn the
          fountain of the Gold mine has not yet been discovered and according to present operation
          will not be likely to be discovered except by accident, as the course of the diluvial
          current has not been noticed and persons not practically acquainted with Ores might pass
          it without observing, however scientific, from what has been found and the area covered
          there, must be an immence fountain and it must crop out somewhere. The discovery of the
          fountains veins ought to be made by Government. I have oportunities to be engaged for
          private companies, but should prefer operating under the Government of the
            <abbr>U.S.</abbr> and if any one can be appointed for that purpose, should be pleased to
          receive it, can produce satisfactory recommendations and would confine my operations for
          the <abbr>U.S.</abbr> I shall be prepared to go soon. If my services should be secured for
          the Government a few hundred Dollars outfit would be necessary and my whole attention
          Given to the Subject.</p>

        <salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>I have received your letter of the 11th Instant.<note place="foot" n="1">Letter not
            found.</note> I remember the conversation which you held with me, in relation to the
          necessity of an additional apartment, to be used as an office or study in connection with
          your Quarters at West Point. I will call the attention of the Secretary of War to the
          subject, and if there be no appropriation applicable to such an object, I will request him
          to bring it to the notice of the Military committees of Congress.</p>
        <p>I was gratified to learn from your letter that [the]<note place="foot" n="2">Word here

          Point, in whose welfare I take a personal interest were “doing credit to themselves &amp;
          [their] friends.” In the absence of any other information, than the monthly conduct
          Reports, I feared it might be otherwise with my nephew <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Cadet Marshall T. Polk</name>
                    </hi>. He is a fine boy, and has no vicious
          habits of which I am aware. He is however fond of gaiety and of amusements, and I
          apprehended, might not be as attentive to his duties, as he should be. He has recived more
          Demerit marks for <hi rend="italics">October</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italics">November</hi>
          than he should, and I have written him a strong earnest <pb/>admonitory letter on the
            subject.<note place="foot" n="3">
                        <name type="person">Polk</name> to <name type="person">Marshall T. Polk, Jr.</name>, <date when="1848-12-18">December 18,
            1848</date>.</note> He is the only child of my deceased brother, and since he has been
          at the Point he has lost his mother, who was a pious &amp; excellent woman. I am his
          guardian and he has lived with me for the last four years. I take as deep an intrest in
          his welfare as if he were my own son. He has I know great respect for you, (having often
          heard you preach in this City) and I have no doubt he would receive kindly any advice
          which you might think proper at any time to give him. May I ask the favour of you, to keep
          an eye to him, and to exercise a parental care over him, as far as you may think it
          prudent or proper, and as may be consistent with your official duties? He is without a
          fortune, and I wish him impressed with the idea, that he is to rely upon his own good
          conduct and character, and not on me, for his success in future life. Situated as he is,
          youths of his age, sometimes take up false impressions and conclude that there is no
          necessity of making personal exertions. I have feared that he may be disposed to fall into
          this course, and rely more on my support, than upon his own resources. In this I may be
          mistaken, but I mention it, that you may disabuse his mind on this point, should you deem
          it necessary. I will esteem it a personal favour, if you will occasionally write to me in
          regard to him.</p>

        <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
        <p>I should have answer’d your letters of <date when="--09-06">Septr. 6th</date> much sooner
          but for my engagements in the late Canvass &amp; my necessary absence from the State since
          its termination. I remember the conversation alluded to by <name type="person">Mr.
            Blair</name>. We had many others previous to that time on the subject of annexation
          &amp; untill about the time of the publication of <name type="person">Mr. Van
            Burens</name> letter against it, I knew of no one apparently more ardent in its support
          than he was. He knew that <name type="person">Genl. Jacksons</name> letter to me had much
          influence in inducing <name type="person">Mr Tyler</name> to enter upon the accomplishment
          of that great measure &amp; for weeks if not for months held that letter or a copy of it,
          in his possession ready for publication whenever it was believed by me that the proper
          time had arrived. The distinct understanding between us was, that its publication was to
          be followed up by the ablest editorials in the Globe: &amp; I think if that paper is
          examined it will be found that <name type="person">Mr. Blair</name>, did write &amp;
          publish one or more, just before the appearance of <name type="person">Mr Van
          Buren</name>’s letter. That letter &amp; the subsequent course of <name type="person">Mr.
            Benton</name>, were understood to effect the public course of <name type="person">Mr
            Blair</name>—but not to change his personal &amp; sincere wish for the success of the
          measure. This <pb/>is not strange when it is rememberd. that whilst <name type="person">Mr. Benton</name> &amp; <name type="person">Mr. Van Buren</name> were so hostile to
          annexation, in the form at least then proposed, <name type="person">Genl Jackson</name>
          towards whom <name type="person">Mr Blair</name>’s devotion was well known, was doing all
          he could by his correspondence with me, with <name type="person">Mr. Blair</name> himself
          &amp; many others to bring about its accomplishment. I sincerely sympathized with him in
          the delicacy &amp; embarrassment of his position &amp; felt free to converse with him, as
          he manifested a desire to do, when we met on the occasion alluded to, on Pennsylvania
          avenue, he going toward the Capital I returning from it about the hour of adjournment. In
          that conversation he expressd. his deep regret, at the wide difference of opinion &amp;
          want of harmony which had sprung up on the question &amp; earnestly put to me the question
          whether in my opinion, there was no way, by which the party could be united on it. My
          reply was prompt &amp; ready. I said <name type="person">Mr. Benton</name> ought to recede
          from his <hi rend="italics">Bill</hi> which stood out in the opinion of nearly every body
          as hostile &amp; antagonistic to the resolution of the house. That the substance of the
          provisions of <hi rend="italics">his bill</hi>, might be thrown into the form of <hi rend="italics">a resolution</hi> &amp; then added as an <hi rend="italics">amendment</hi>, not a <hi rend="italics">substitute</hi>, to that of the house. This
          course would require no concession from either branch of the party &amp; ought &amp; would
          I thought heal up the breach that seemed every day deepening &amp; widening in the
          democratic party. My reply was the more prompt because I had meditated much on the subject
          &amp; had days before taken steps as <name type="person">Mr. Jacob Thompson</name> &amp;
          probably <name type="person">Mr. Senator Sevier</name> would inform you, which <pb/>I have
          allways considerd as having led to the “Walker amendment” finally adopted &amp; voted for
          by <name type="person">Mr. Benton</name> &amp; <name type="person">Mr. Tappan</name>
          themselves.</p>
        <p>
                    <name type="person">Mr. Blair</name> asserts, that these votes &amp; others were procured
          solely by the pledges which he says you gave &amp; yet I apprehend that various senators
          who attended the Caucus which took into consideration, this mode of passing the measure,
          can recollect no dissent then given by any of the Senators mentioned by him as having only
          assented to it on the ground of <hi rend="italics">your</hi> pledges, given subsequent to
          that Caucus if given at all.</p>
        <p>I should suppose <name type="person">Mr Senator Walker</name> could inform you who was at
          that caucus—Was <name type="person">Mr. Benton</name> there &amp; did he signify any
          opposition to it—Was <name type="person">Mr Tappan</name> there &amp; did he give into it
          on account of your assurances to <name type="person">Mr Blair</name> or any body else
          &amp; in fact was any thing said at that meeting about your having given any pledges at
          all to any body or through any body? If I understand the period when <name type="person">Mr Blair</name> says he consulted you, it must have been after the meeting to which I
          allude &amp; at which the <name type="person">Walker</name> amendment was agreed upon as
          one on which the whole party could probably harmonize. I do not pretend to know the
          particulars of that meeting—who were there &amp;c. as it was one composed only of
          Senators. I speak of it only as I heard at the time &amp; I feel sure that I never
          understood that its action was at all influenced by any thing coming from you in the way
          alleged, &amp; I regarded it at the time as the ripening &amp; consummation of the plan
          which I had proposed through <name type="person">Mr. Jacob Thompson</name> &amp; <name type="person">Mr Senator Sevier</name>, two warm, energetic &amp; very useful
          <pb/>friends in its final accomplishments. I give these details now for the first time in
          any written communication, because they are well calculated to refute the idea which <name type="person">Mr. Tappan</name> seems to have taken up, that the plan of blending the
          two propositions originated with you, when I feel very sure that your attention had not
          been turned with any particularity to the merits of the respective <hi rend="italics">forms</hi> of annexation then pending.</p>
        <p>
                    <name type="person">Mr Blair</name> speaks of my having <hi rend="italics">desired
            him</hi> to see <name type="person">Mr Benton</name> &amp; the friends of his
          proposition, submit my plans to them, &amp; then see you on the subject, &amp;c. If he
          would reflect a little he could readily see why I would hardly ask his agency in
          submitting any plan of mine (<hi rend="italics">as mine)</hi> to the consideration of Mr
          Benton at that period; but on the suggestion of the doubts which he says he expressd.
          whether the plan mentiond would be satisfactory, I might well have replied as I think it
          probable I did, that all parties were present in the city &amp; he on friendly relations
          to all &amp; he as a democrat &amp; a good friend to annexation ought &amp; could
          ascertain from them whether such a plan would be satisfactory.</p>
        <p>Whether <name type="person">Mr Blair</name> ever had any interviews with you, I never
          heard from you or him—although intimate with both—nor did I ever hear from him or any body
          else during my stay at Washington, any complaints of your having violated any pledges or
          disappointed their expectations in any part of your action on the subject of annexation. I
          heard it is true in some quarters complaints of the action of <name type="person">Mr.
            Tyler</name> as indelicate &amp; precipitate, (which I was far from thinking myself) but
          none whatsoever <pb/>of yours.</p>
        <p>I have looked over the letters of both these gentlemen &amp; feel at some loss to
          understand the precise impression intended to be made by them. Was it to shew that the
            <name type="person">Van Buren</name> or <name type="person">Benton</name> wing of the
          democratic portion of the Senate, although they voted for annexation ought not to be
          responsible for the war that followed, because <name type="person">Mr. Bentons</name> form
          was the <hi rend="italics">pacific</hi> one? And how was it more <hi rend="italics">pacific</hi> towards <name type="place">Mexico</name>? Both forms were intended to
          annex <name type="place">Texas</name> to the United States &amp; if that was done, the
          country would be lost by <name type="place">Mexico</name>, by one mode as much as by the
          other—both forms then were equally <hi rend="italics">hostile</hi> to her &amp; neither
          could be regarded as <hi rend="italics">pacific</hi>. Annexation in any form, was to be
          the cause of offence to her, not the mode or the terms of it. <name type="person">Mr.
            Blair</name> states the motive for clinging to <name type="person">Mr Benton</name>’s
          proposition, to be, to render annexation more <hi rend="italics">palatable</hi> to <name type="place">Mexico</name>, by giving her <hi rend="italics">a pecuniary
            consideration</hi>, for the territory desired by the <name type="place">U. States</name>
          &amp; to which <name type="place">Texas</name> could justly assert any title. Now this is
          very strange language indeed, when it is rememberd. that the commissioners contemplated in

            considera[tion]<note place="foot" n="1">Letters cut off side of page.</note> or
          otherwise in reconciling her to annexation. The house resolution left the Western boundary
          (the only one disputable) subject to negotiation &amp; the general diplomatic powers of
          the President could have offerd (as it subsequently did) any amount of money to render
          <pb/>annexation pallatable to <name type="place">Mexico</name>. To suppose it proper for
          the President to have selected <name type="person">Mr. Bentons</name> proposition rather
          than that of the house, for any of the reasons set forth by <name type="person">Mr.
            Blair</name> or <name type="person">Mr. Tappan</name>, is therefore evidently absurd
          &amp; inconsistent with the stubborn facts of the case. Every Member of the house who
          voted for the resolutions of that body, must feel some degree of reflection cast upon him
          by those letters; for if it was such an outrageous act in the president (<name type="person">Mr. Tyler</name> [&amp; yourself])<note place="foot" n="2">Brown struck
            out the bracketed text in this sentence.</note> to select &amp; submit, these
          resolutions, leading so directly &amp; inevitably to War as these gentlemen pretend, it
          must have been highly censurable in them to have <hi rend="italics">voted</hi> for them.
          The Spirit in which <name type="person">Mr. Tappan</name>’s was written may be judged of
          by noticing the paragraph in which, speaking of his vote against the Tyler Treaty, he says
          “it appeared to me (him) that the whole affair afforded evidence of a daring conspiracy to
          divide the Union by arraying the free &amp; slave States against each other”—a daring
          conspiracy—the whole affair of it—to divide the Union!—&amp; yet that Senator knows from
          various publications which must have met his eye, that <name type="person">Genl
            Jackson</name>’s great name lay at the bottom of this imperfect measure—That <name type="person">Mr. Tyler</name> never ventured upon it, untill he had the assurance that
            <name type="person">Genl Jackson</name> would stand by him in it. He knows too, that the
          large majority of his own party (we thought all of them) at the Baltimore convention
          approved &amp; even demanded the annexation of Texas &amp; yet the whole affar of it, in
          the summer of <date when="1848">1848</date>, seems to him a daring conspiracy to dissolve
          the Union!</p>
        <p>
                    <pb/>You must pardon me for making these comments, beyond a simple statements of
          conversations &amp;c. for I have had to bear the force of these letters in my late canvass
          of the State, in which they have done some damage to the democratic party &amp; in which I
          have been compelled to point out their errors &amp; absurdities.</p>

        <salute>My Dear Sir</salute>
        <p>I have receiveed and read with great satisfaction, your last message, which you did me
          the honor to send me a copy of.</p>
        <p>It is scarcely necessary for me to repeat how much I approve the principles of your
          administration as fully revieweed and Vindicated in that message.</p>
        <p>Would that we could anticipate or even hope, that they might prevail in the Measures of
          your successor. Under the auspices with which <name type="person">Genl. Taylor</name> has
          been brought into power, and from the fatal &amp; mischievous errors which he has
          Sanctioned by his approval, so far as he <pb/>has chosen to give any intimation of his
          opinions on political subjects, we can indulge no expectation, favurable to the sound and
          constitutional, features of your administration, but can only look for a struggle to erase
          what has been so well and successfully done. We are, I fear, to have a sort of political
          unravelling of Penelopes webb, for the next four years and a renewal of all those
          dangerous and unconstitutional measures and systems, which we had supposed the
          administration of <name type="person">Genl. Jackson</name> and yours had finally
          overthrown.</p>
        <p>You at least will have the consolation, in your retirement, of knowing that you have done
          your duty faithfully and firmly, and your friends the Satisfaction of knowing that you
          have fulfilled all their hopes and expectations. As one of them I take pleasure in
          repeating the expression of that satisfaction.</p>
        <p>I perceive by the papers that you contemplate, on your return home after the 4th March,
          taking the Southern route.</p>
        <p>The principal object of troubling you with this note, is to request that you and <name type="person">Mrs. Polk</name> would visit us and stay with us while you remain in <name type="place">Richmond</name>. It will give <name type="person">Mrs. Patton</name> and
          myself great pleasure to have you with us, in a friendly and social way.</p>

        <salute>My dear Sir</salute>
        <p>I am very much honored and obliged by a copy of your Message which you were kind enough
          to send me and which I received a short time since. I am very much gratified at the
          forcible manner in which you have reviewed the measures of your administration, the whole
          of which meets my unqualified approval and I am pleased that I was permitted to have some
          humble share in promoting the important measures consummated in the first Session of the
          29th Congress; and although the misrepresentations in regard to the Mexican War
          contributed greatly to prevent my re election I am fully compensated for any personal
          defeat by the inestimable results to the country: the consequences of that War. The
          valuable acquisition of territory now developed in the gold regions of California <hi rend="italics">alone</hi> has demonstrated sooner than was anticipated the wise policy
          which has characterised your administration and has completely dissipated and falsified
          the confident assertions of the Whigs made last fall, that the territory was utterly
          valueless: an assertion that I had to <pb/>combat in this district as elector without
          expecting that my positions as to the importance of the acquisition would be so soon
          verified.</p>
        <p>I may be permitted in the utmost sincerity to assure you that in my opinion your
          administration has more nearly approached the Republican creed (as I understand it) in its
          practical results than any former administration of our government and therefore I am not
          surprised at the dissatisfaction produced among the Whigs at your bold and truthful
          exposure of the tendency of federal measures and the boasted “American System” which I
          hold with you if carried out in the administration of the Government would change the
          whole character of our institutions and ultimately subvert Republican liberty here. I
          regret to say however that in North Carolina the Democratic party are under a cloud, &amp;
          in a minority that I fear will take a long time to change. We however have fought better
          than could be expected. (without an organization which it has been impossible for us to
          perfect although I have unremittingly urged it.[)]<note place="foot" n="1">Closing
            parenthesis missing.</note>
                </p>
        <p>I have just learned that <name type="person">Mr. Badger</name> after many ballottings is
          re elected to the Senate and I regret that our friends (although they could not have
          elected a Democrat) should have cast their votes for <name type="person">Mr.
            Clingman</name> whom I consider as objectionable if not more so than <name type="person">Mr. Badger</name>. An acknowledgement however has been wrung from Clingman in
          approbation of the measures of your administration. I have just recd. a letter from a
          member of the Legislature who states that Clingman pledged himself against a National Bank
          &amp; the Wilmot proviso and in <pb/>favor of the Independent Treasury and the Tariff of
            <date when="1846">1846</date>.</p>
        <p>I should be gratified if during the short period of your official term the distracting
          Slavery question could be settled and therefore I cordially approve your earnest
          recommendations on that subject, although a consideration of Party policy might desire me
          to throw it upon the incoming administration: for it cannot be doubted that <name type="person">Genl. Taylor</name> if he vetoes the Wilmot proviso will be guilty of a
          gross fraud in obtaining Northern votes, and my observation convinces me if the South
          obtains equality in any portion of the new Territories it can only be expected during your
          administration. If <name type="person">Genl. Taylor</name> approves the Proviso the larger
          portion of the Southern Whigs I believe will justify or excuse him. I am satisfied from my
          canvass this fall that <hi rend="italics">even</hi> in eastern North Carolina a large vote
          could now be obtained for the Proviso if the movement were headed by <hi rend="italics">one</hi> influential man.</p>
        <p>The result of the Presidential election therefore on this question is to <hi rend="italics">divide</hi> the South and unite the North, and what may be the ultimate
          result time only can determine. Certain I am that the South cannot reasonably calculate
          upon securing any thing except it is done during your term and that seems improbable from
          the recent course of the House of Representatives: a course which I predicted would
          certainly be pursued in the <hi rend="italics">next</hi> Congress. I very much fear that
          the spirit of Abolition is making such rapid progress, that in a few years the Northern
          slaveholding States will be <hi rend="italics">compelled</hi> to surrender the question:
          if for a <pb/>few years even we should be spared intense excitement followed by violent
          outbreaks.</p>
        <p>I hope for the best but fear the worst and therefore I repeat my admiration and approval
          of your course in pressing the question with earnestness before the excitement becomes
          uncontrollable.</p>
        <p>But I did not commence this letter with the intention of trespassing upon your time in
          speculations upon political subjects but to express my thanks for your recollection of a
          friend now in private life and to assure you of the warm approval of your message by one
          who feels a deep and abiding interest in the welfare of the country.</p>
        <p>Please present my kindest regards to <name type="person">Mrs. Polk</name>, and beleive me
          while I have the honor to subscribe myself . . . .</p>

          It is our <pb/>present purpose to take the Southern route, which though longer than that
          across the mountains, is for the convenience of travel with a heavy baggage, to be
          preferred. I had not contemplated making any stop at Richmond, but if the arrangements of

        <salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
        <p>I received an hour ago your message. But I had read it already. It was published more
          than a week ago in all the English papers, and circulated throughout all this kingdom
          &amp; the continent. Never has a President had such a story to tell; and, what I think
          still more to your honor, never has a President presented the unadulterated principles of
          democracy with more clearness or more fidelity. Here the world is astonished at the
          extraordinary results of your administration, &amp; only wonder how in America there can
          be two opinions about it. England acquiesces in all you have done; and had you even
          purchased <name type="place">Cuba</name>, <pb/>
                    <name type="place">England</name> would
          have submitted quietly.</p>
        <p>And now I want your advice. Had I better resign on the <date when="--03-04">4th of
            March</date>, or wait. It is all a matter of very little importance to me except as I
          wish to act rightly &amp; to act wisely.</p>
        <p>I have recd <name type="person">Johnson</name>’s report which is excellent all but close.
          A Postmaster General removable only by impeachment with postmasters holding office during
          good behavior, would make the Post Office the most complete whig electioneering machine
          that can be imagined. That advice of <name type="person">Johnson</name>’s is all wrong;
          how he came to adopt such a thoroughly whig project I cannot imagine. It is diametrically
          opposed to all our democratic doctrines. But the separation of the Postmaster General from
          the Cabinet, &amp; his appointment for a term of years not exceeding four, are good
          practical measures.</p>
        <p>You wished a copy of the Mecklenburg Resolves of <date when="1775-05">May
            1775</date>.<note place="foot" n="1">

        <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
        <p>Haveing no doubt but that your mind will meet with Employment arduous Enough in
          concluding the various duties which must inevitably await you in closeing one of the most
          Auspicious and Successful Administrations of which it is in the province of the Goverment
          Justly to Boast although we can boast of many good yet none have been under Such
          Embarressed circumstances So Successfully carried out with So little Embarrassment to the
          people; and without wishing to flatter you permit me to say you had my Confidence from the
          beginning and I hailed your Nomination in, 44, as a harbenger of good to this Country and
          I warmly Supported you at the Election and I regret that such a Shameful quarrel Exists in
          this State as has had the Effect to throw the power of the Goverment for the next 4 years
          into the possession of the Whigs. Nevertheless your retiring from Office will be as
          Triumphant as your inauguration and it is thought by many that your Country will again
          Call you to the helm in: 52. I will nevertheless pray for the Best Notwithstanding I
          should be Truly gratified to see you re Elected in, <date when="1852">1852</date>
                    <note place="foot" n="2">New sentence may begin before or after “Notwithstanding . . . <date when="1852">1852</date>.”</note> yet in the intervening Time I Truly hope that the
          Councils of the Nation may be Such as to favourably promote the advancement and interest
          of those that are governed and that you in common may rejoice <pb/>to see the policy of
          your wise Administration looked to for a precedent for the Succeeding 4 years. I cannot
          think they will disturb the Tariff or independant Treasury and if not there will be no
          danger of a National Bank. By, the, By I have a Son <name type="person">Joseph S</name>.
          that was 17 year Old last Oct. and is pretty large of his age very active and Energetick
          whose appearance is Somewhat prepossessing and he is anxious to graduate at the Military
          Academy at West point. Will the Multitude of your business in Concluding your
          Administration permit your Excellency to compliment So humble an Individual by Aiding in
          Introducing his Son to that Institution? If not I know that your Other important business
          in which the Whole people are concerned occupies your Time and therefore your Devotion is
          more wisely appropriated and all is Submitted by me to your own better Judgement and more

        <salute>Sir</salute>
        <p>It was with pleasure, I witnessed your prompt and zealous efforts last summer to
          discountenance, and prevent the re assembling of a mob in this City; and I believe, if it
          had not been for the measures you adopted, and the advice you gave, that private property
          would have been destroyed, and the character of the City, seriously affected.</p>
        <p>An occurrence of the kind here, and on that occasion, would have caused a deep sensation
          throughout the nation. The co-operation of the city authorities and prominent citizens to
          act efficiently in unison, resulted from the order you gave to the Departments, to
          restrain the Clerks from appearing in any assemblage, that might collect the following
          night; and from the remark you made “that the peace of the City should be preserved, and
          if the power of the corporation should not be adequate, that you would exercise every
          constitutional power applicable to the case, with which the President was cloathe’d.”</p>
        <p>As a temporary Citizen of the District, and as a citizen of the United States, it has
          been my desire to bear this testimony to you, which I have on many occasions borne to
          others.</p>

        <p>Your kind letter<note place="foot" n="1">
                        <name type="person">Polk</name> to <name type="person">Sprole</name>, <date when="1848-12-19">December 19, 1848</date>.</note>
          was duly recd. I feel grateful to you for your continued interest in my welfare and the
          direction you have given in relation to my personal comfort. As you perceive from the date
          of this letter, we are now busily engaged in our semi-annual examination. My young friend
            <name type="person">Cadet Polk</name> was examined yesterday in mathematics and
          sustained himself remarkably well. He stands well up in the Second section of a talented
          class, and has the best regards of all his instructors for his success. His demerit marks
          which have occasioned you some uneasiness arose more from carelessness than any thing
          else, and I have his promise that the next report will take to <name type="place">Washington</name> a clean sheet. I have felt since he entered the Academy a deep
          interest in him, and have regretted that the usages &amp; regulations of the Institution
          are such that I <pb/>cannot <hi rend="italics">show more concern for him</hi>, without
          leading others to suppose that I inclined to be too partial. I wish you in your next
          letter to him, to urge his visiting my house more often than he does. Having a room-mate,
          of course I cannot take as freely to him, as I could in my own house. He has a very
          good-heart, full of life and I believe now free from vice. The great thing is to keep him
          so, and of this there is but little doubt, if his associates are pure. In an Institution
          like this, we must needs have many whose early training has been defective, &amp; their
          habits bad. Young men whose moral developements are rather the effect of criminal neglect,
          than vicious principle—whose want of good is more their misfortune than their fault. Some
          such grow worse and others improve. Now it is often the case that these are among the most
          talented, &amp; consequently the most influential &amp; dangerous to the habits of their
          companions. I regard it as a very favourable circumstance that the most talented in the
          class of which <name type="person">Cadet Polk</name> is a member, are excellent young men,
          some of the best in the Institution. Now as there is not much intercourse between the
          different classes—the intimacy of young men being to some extent restricted to their own
          class, there is less danger to be apprehended from bad example &amp; association than
          there might be. Unless some great &amp; unexpected change should take place—and of which I
          have not the most remote fear, your Nephew will pass through the Academy with very very
          great credit.</p>
        <p>If it be not troubling you with too long a letter, allow me to ask if <pb/>you think
          there is any probability of an effort being made for my removal after your Successor has
          entered upon this duties of his office. I have not heard a syllable in relation to any
          such thing, but it is natural I should be anxious, having a family of little children
          depending entirely upon my Salary. I would not despair of finding a home in the church
          even should I be removed, yet to be displaced suddenly would of course subject me to great
          mental anguish &amp; it might be some domestic distress. I know not that I should trouble
          you with this matter at all, but I must confess my concern for my family has started some
          anxiety in my own mind.</p>

          letters I have the impression, that you entertained apprehensions, that some one may have
          communicated information to me, calculated to affect you injuriously.<note place="foot" n="2">
                        <name type="person">Polk</name> refers to <name type="person">Armstrong</name>’s
            letters of <date when="--05-19">May 19</date> and <date when="--10-02">October

          your prejudice. I <pb/>have known you too long, and too well, to credit idle rumours, and
          have undiminished confidence in you.</p>
        <p>The Presidential election having resulted unfavourably to the Democratic party, it may be
          that you contemplate resigning your post, in order to avoid a removal, by my successor. If
          you desire to continue in your consulate, or if it be a matter of indifference to you,
          whether you do or not, my advice to you is, not to resign, but to hold on for a few months
          at least. A removal for <hi rend="italics">opinion’s sake</hi> could not injuriously
          affect your reputation, but on the contrary, would endear you still more to the Democratic
          party. The President elect, in one of [his]<note place="foot" n="3">Word here and below
            uncertain, light and blurred ink transfer.</note> letters as published, has said, that
          he was a Whig, but not an <hi rend="italics">ultra Whig</hi>. Precding the election his
          friends in different quarters of the Union, represented him as a <hi rend="italics">no
            party man</hi>, &amp; by this means he obtained many Democratic votes. That this was a
          fraud I do not doubt. Indeed I have never known a [public]-man who professed to belong to
            <hi rend="italics">no party</hi>, who was not when he obtained power a proscriptive, if
          not a vindictive partisan. Your case would test the <hi rend="italics">no party</hi>
          professions of the President elect, and of his leading frieds. If [. . .]<note place="foot" n="4">Word or letters here and below cut off side of page.</note> shall prescribe “<hi rend="italics">for opinion’s sake</hi>,” the early [an]d constant friend of <hi rend="italics">Jackson</hi>, one who fell wounded in battle by his side, and who of all the officers,
          of all grades who had been under his command, was deemed by him most worthy to intrust his
            <hi rend="italics">war sword</hi>, the public will be at no loss to understand and to
          appreciate the insincerity of the professions of moderation, which were made before the
          election.</p>

                    <pb/>I am surrounded by company and much engaged in my official duties, and have no time

        <salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>I congratulate you upon your success in the negotiation of the Postal Treaty. I submitted
          it to the Senate on yesterday, and to day that body advised and consented to its
          ratification. If it can be prepared in time, at the State Department, the Ratification on
          My part will be transmitted to you by the <hi rend="italics">Next Steamer</hi>. This may
          be the last of the important measures, consummated, during the term of my eventful
          administration. Whether it be or not I shall retire with a consciousness, of having with
          unceasing attention to public affairs and with great labour and anxiety, faithfully
          discharged my duty, and I shall I hope leave my country prosperous and happy. Some of the
          leading Whigs say I have had good luck. I care not to what they attribute the success
          which may have attended the measures of my administration, if that success shall result in
          the permanent good of the country. Of the effects of my policy, posterity, as well as the
          present generation must judge. There is but one open question which gives me any serious
          concern and which I am anxious to settle before I retire, and that is the question of
          providing Governments, for the inhabitants of the immense territories, acquired by
          <pb/>the Treaty with <name type="place">Mexico</name>. In the present temper of Congress,
          and in view of the great diversity of opinion which prevails, I fear this cannot be done
          at the present Session. The slavery question constitutes the sole and great obstacle, to
          an adjustment. With the <hi rend="italics">Wilmot Proviso</hi>, incorporated into any
          Bill, and applied to territory South of 36°. 30"., it cannot become a law; and I fear
          that no Bill without such provision can pass the Ho. Repts. The only hope as I think is,
          to admit <hi rend="italics">California</hi> into the Union, as a <hi rend="italics">State</hi>, as soon as the inhabitants, shall adopt and present a Republican State
          constitution, without requiring them to pass through the intermediate stage of a
          Territorial Government under the authority of the U. States. In this form Northern as well
          as Southern Democrats can vote against any restriction, upon the subject of slavery, as
          being incompatable with the right of the people interested, to adopt and regulate their
          own Domestic Institutions. If this plan shall not succeed, (and I entertain great fear it
          will not) nothing will probably be done at the present Session of Congress. If government
          could be secured for <hi rend="italics">California</hi>, the government of the Province of
            <name type="place">New Mexico</name>, being interior country, without sea-coast, and
          with a sparse population, might if necessary be postponed. I hope for the best, but fear
          the worst. My apprehensions are, that if nothing be done, at the present session, there is
          imminent danger that <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="place">California</name>
                    </hi> may be
          lost to the Union. My reasons are, that attracted by the recently discovered mineral
          weath, and the vast commercial advantages of that country, the emigration to it will be
          rapid <pb/>beyond any former example. I should not be surprised, if before the end of
          August, there, should be a population of an hundred, perhaps an hundred and fifty thousand
          souls. This mass of people of every lineage &amp; tongue will be congregated together,
          without law or government. They cannot long remain in this condition. Among them will
          undoubtedly be men of adventure and desperate fortune, men of talents and ambition and men
          of Capital. They will naturally form a Government for themselves, will establish
          custom-houses, and may collect a large revenue. They may style themselves the California
          Republic, or uniting Oregon, the Pacific Republic. In this condition of things, when
          Congress shall assemble next December, they may be in a <hi rend="italics">quasi</hi>
          State of revolt, declaring their disinclination to be connected with our Union of States.
          Should this be so, the Federal party, who will be in power, will be ready to give up the
          country. The instincts of that party have always, been opposed to the extension of our
          territorial limits. This was manifeested in thir opposition to the acquisition of <name type="place">Louisiana</name>, of the Floridies and of <name type="place">Texas</name>.
          Less than a year ago, the same party, in Congress, and out of it, were opposed, to the
          acquisition of any territory as an indemnity from <name type="place">Mexico</name>. With
          their opinions they will I apprehend be ready to avail themselves of any plausible pretext
          to surrendur up the territory acquired. They would moreover be able to relieve themselves
          from embarrassment as a political party by such a course. In the late Presidential
          election they represented <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Genl. Taylor</name>
                    </hi>
          to be a <hi rend="italics">Wilmot Proviso</hi>
          <pb/>man at the North; and a pro slavery man at the South. By giving up the country they
          would save him from the necessity of acting on the subject. These are my apprehensions. I
          pray God that they may be without foundation. But I have said much more on this subject
          than I have intended to do, when I commenced this letter, &amp; will not trouble you
          further with my speculations.</p>
        <p>I suppose you may be preparing to surrender the Mission which you have so ably filled,
          for I have a strong impression, that the incoming administration, will be more
          proscriptive than any which has preceded it. It is true that the President elect, in one
          of his numerous letters as published has said, that he is a Whig, but not an <hi rend="italics">ultra Whig</hi>, and it is also true, that he was represented by his
          friends during the pendency of the Presidential election as a no <hi rend="italics">party
            man</hi>, but notwithstanding all this, those who will be about him will probably
          require him to proscribe for “<hi rend="italics">opinion’s sake</hi>,” all who hold
          desireable places under the Government. Indeed I have never known a professed <hi rend="italics">no-party man</hi>, who sought and obtained popular favour and power upon
          that ground, who did not turn out to be a proscriptive, if not a vindictive partisan. All
          such professions are but frauds practiced on the people. Whatever the course of <hi rend="italics">President Taylor</hi> may be in this respect, my advice to you is, <hi rend="italics">not to resign</hi>. If you are removed, it can be for no cause other than
          your political opinions, and could not injuriously affect your reputation. On the contrary
          your recal would endear you still more to the Democratic party. My clear opinion is,
          <pb/>that you should hold on to your mission, and throw the responsibility of your recal,
          upon the President elect, if he chooses to take it.</p>
        <p>I look forward <hi rend="italics">My Dear Sir</hi>, with sincre pleasure to the period,
          now near at hand, when I shall retire from the cares, and anxieties of my responsible
          station.</p>
        <p>You have not answered my letter written in September last, requesting you to procure
          &amp; forward to me, copies, all the official papers in the Brittish archives, upon the
          subject of the Declaration of Independence made by the people of Mecklenburg <name type="place">N. Carolina</name> in <date when="1775-05">May 1775</date>, or which go to

                </p>
        <p>I have written a much longer letter than I had intended. I have written in haste, after
          the labours of the day, were over and late at night. I have no opportunity to revise it,
          nor is this necessary. Should you be recalled, <hi rend="italics">

        <salute>Dear Sir.</salute>
        <p>Be so kind as to pardon the liberty I now take, in troubling you with the perusal of a
          few lines. I have two sons who wish to go to the gold regions of <name type="place">California</name>, early in the spring. The eldest, <name type="person">Joseph W.
            Bell</name>, is an attorney at law, &amp; resides in <name type="place">Nashville</name>; the younger, <name type="person">Benjamin F. Bell</name>, is a
          physician &amp; a resident of this County. They are qualified, honest &amp; respectable,
          but not wealthy. As it is believed that a branch of the mint will be located in <name type="place">California</name>, they wish an Office in that, or something else, that
          will enable them to support themselves. <name type="person">Hon. John Bell</name>, of the
          Senate, can inform you of <name type="person">Joseph</name>, and <name type="person">Hon.
            Andrew Johnson</name>, of the House, can satisfy you, as to <name type="person">Benjamin</name>. My object is to solicit, for my sons aforesaid, your favor, or
          patronage, in obtaining some civil office, or clerkship in <name type="place">California</name>. Should you feel it consistent with your views of propriety, to favor
          my sons, you will not be disappointed of your wish to promote the public good. They have
          no epauletted recommendation—all they can show, is unblemished Character, and
          qualification equal to the <pb/>discharge of the duties of any Office, which they may be
          fortunate enough to occupy. But if you feel unwilling to grant my request, you will still
          have my warmest friendship, and support at the Ballot box, where you have always had it.
          May God give you and yours, a high seat in the other world. He has given you, on earth,
          the highest seat occupied by man; and you have spread glory and honor over regions of
          darkness, and the gold is rising, as by charm, to enrich the mighty republic over which
          you preside.</p>

        <salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>It is at this moment uncertain, whether Congress will at its present session, provide any
          Governments for the territories acquired from <name type="place">Mexico</name> by the
          Treaty of Peace. In the present temper of that body, and especially when the conflict of
          opinion upon the slave-question which exists between the different sections of the Union,
          is considered, I regret to say that the probabilities are that Nothing will be done. I
          have not time now to give you the reasons for these apprehensions. I fear if nothing be
          <pb/>done at the present session, that <name type="place">California</name>, may set up an
          Independent Government &amp; that fine country be lost to the Union. Though the slavery
          question may prevent Congress from doing their duty in this respect, they will I think
          create a Board of commissioners, to adjudicate the claims of our citizens against Mexico,
          which by the terms of the Treaty were assumed by the United States. In that event the
          appointment of the commissioners will devolve on me, before the expiration of my term.
          Many persons of high character and distinguished standing in the country have already been
          presented to me for these appointments. I am under no commitments to any one, but have
          thought it probable that the <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Hon. John B.
              Weller</name>
                    </hi> of <name type="place">Ohio</name>, (whom you know) and the <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Hon. John Anderson</name>
                    </hi> of Maine, with whom I
          served many years in Congress, might be two of them. If such a situation would be
          agreeable to you, and you will so signify to me, it would give me sincere pleasure to
          apoint you on the commission with these gentlemen, or any other whom I may finally make up
          my mind to appoint. The office of commissioner will be one of dignity and high
          responsibility. It will be such a commission as was filled by <hi rend="italics">White</hi>, <hi rend="italics">Tazewell</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italics">King</hi>, under
          the <name type="place">Spanish</name> Treaty, by which we acquired the Floridas; and such
          as was filled by <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Judge Campbell</name>
                    </hi> of
            <name type="place">Nashville</name>, <hi rend="italics">Saunders</hi> of [. . .]<note place="foot" n="1">Word or words cut off side of page.</note>
          <hi rend="italics">Kane</hi> of <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>, under the French
          Treaty. Being in the Nature of a Judicial office, I think it probable that the rule of
          proscription for “<hi rend="italics">opinion’s sake</hi>,” which may be adopted by my
          successor, would not be applied.</p>
        <p>
                    <pb/>A few weeks ago I nominated to the Senate the late <hi rend="italics">Senator <name type="person">Sevier</name>
                    </hi> of <name type="place">Arkansas</name>, to be
          commissioner to run the boundary line beteen the <abbr>U.S.</abbr> and <name type="place">Mexico</name>, in pursuance of the provisions of the Treaty. The nomination has not yet
          been acted on, and I understand that doubts have been raised in the Senate, whether as <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Sevier</name>
                    </hi> was a member of the Senate,
          when the Treaty was ratified, he is eligible to the office under the constitution. Should
          he be rejected, or should his nomination be withdrawn in consequence of the doubts of his
          eligibility by Senators, and you would prefer this situation to a place on the commission
          to adjudicate claims, &amp; you will so inform me, I will send in your name in his stead.
          Should he be rejected or be withdrawn, I will communicate with you by <hi rend="italics">Telegraph</hi> in these words “Sevier has been rejected” [or]<note place="foot" n="2">Possible underline within quotation marks or punctuation surrounding them cut off
            bottom of page; word in brackets either absent or cut off bottom of page.</note> “<hi rend="italics">Sevier has been withdrawn</hi>” as the case may be. You can respond with
            “<hi rend="italics">I accept</hi>,” or “<hi rend="italics">I decline</hi>” as you may
          decide. I mention this because this office, must be filled by me, wheras the commission to
          adjudicate claims may possibly not be created, though the strong probabilit[ies]<note place="foot" n="3">Letters cut off side of page.</note> are that it will be.</p>
        <p>I received your letter last summer,<note place="foot" n="4">
                        <name type="person">Brown</name> to <name type="person">Polk</name>, <date when="--07-12">July 12</date>
            and c. <date when="1848-07-25">July 25, 1848</date>.</note> but did not answer it,
          preferring to see you personally, &amp; make such explanations as I am sure would be
          satisfactory to you.</p>
        <p>I have received your letter of the 20th ultimo, in reply to mine upon another subject
          written in September last,<note place="foot" n="5">
                        <name type="person">Polk</name> to

            (both such letters).</note> &amp; thank you for it. There is one point, probably from
          inadvertence upon which you are silent. It is in <pb/>relation to any conversation you may
          have had with me on the subject of annexation, after my arrival in <name type="place">Washington</name> in <date when="1845-02">February 1845</date>. As however it is not
          now probable that any thing will be done on the subject until after I retiree, I will have
          an opportunity to see you on this point.</p>

        <salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>I was much gratified to receive your letter of the 27th ultimo.<note place="foot" n="1">Letter not found.</note> The noble sentiments which you avow, are just such as I
          expected from you, and you will permit me to say, do you high honour. I wish they could be
          known to the public, for if they were, they would endear you still more, to all the
          lovers, of the Union. If you could be returned to the Senate <hi rend="italics">uninstructed</hi> upon the <hi rend="italics">Wilmot Proviso</hi> or <hi rend="italics">slavery question</hi>, you could from your position before the country, do more to
          adjust that, delicate and <pb/>most dangerous, sectional controversy than any man now
          living. Should you be returned to the Senate, and be afterwards <hi rend="italics">instructed</hi>, I concur with you in opinion that, you could do much good, in
          declaring from your position, upon the floor of that dignified body, your views fully,
          upon the occasion of <hi rend="italics">resigning</hi> your seat. One half the country
          would not only admire you, for your firmness in maintaining sound constitutional
          principles, but would be enthusiastically attached to you, for your devotion to the Union
          of the States; whilst in the other half, the sound democracy would stand by you and
          sustain you. Were you driven to resign your seat, under <hi rend="italics">instructions</hi>, it would be a great and a proud occasion, and would give you a fame,
          as a martyr who had fallen, in a mighty struggle to preserve, the Union of the States. I
          have reflected much on the subject, and my opinion is, that you should consent to return
          to the Senate. I should hope that <hi rend="italics">instructions</hi> by your Legislature
          might be prevented by your frieds; but if not and instructions should follow you, you
          could only <hi rend="italics">resign</hi>, and in doing so, make a patriotic appeal to the
          people of all sections, in favour of the preservation of the Union. The State of things in
          Congress, as I described them to you, have not been materially changed since I wrote
            you.<note place="foot" n="2">
                        <name type="person">Polk</name> to <name type="person">Cass</name>, <date when="1848-12-15">December 15, 1848</date>.</note> Were you here I
          should still hope that suitable Governments might be provided for the recently acquird
          Territories, and that in providing them, we might avoid the insuperable embarrassments,
          which the <hi rend="italics">Wilmot Proviso</hi>, would inevitably produce. My language to
          all the members of Congress with whom I have <pb/>conversed, is, to urge conciliation
          &amp; compromise, and to maintain at any hazard, the noble sentiment of <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Genl. Jackson</name>
                    </hi> “<hi rend="italics">Our</hi> Federal
          Union, it must be preserved.”</p>
        <p>I am much gratified that your son’s nomination to <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="place">Rome</name>
                    </hi> was confirmed by the Senate. It met with unexpected and strenuous
          opposition and at one time I feared the reesult. His rejection would have been a triumph
          to the <hi rend="italics">Whigs</hi> over you, but a still greater one over me &amp; the
          Democratic party. I am happy in the belief that I may have contributed, in my intercourse
          with Senators to prevent such a result. Your Son did not call on me after he was
          nominated, but I learn, since his confirmation, that he has returned to Michigan.</p>
        <p>I am heartily rejoiced My Dear Sir: that my term is so near its close. At this late
          period of my administration my official labours continue to be unceasing, and my
          responsibilities very great. I am sure I shall enjoy, my retirement as much as any man
          ever did.</p>

        <salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>I wrote to you last night, and suggested my desire to appoint you as one of the
          commissioners, to adjudicate claims under the Mexican-Treaty, should Congress at its
          present session make provision for the appointment of such a Board, as I thought they
          would. This is a position which I supposed it possible, (but without any knowledge of what
          your views might be) might be agreeable to you. In the same letter I informed you that I
          had nominated the late <hi rend="italics">Senator <name type="person">Sevier</name>
                    </hi>
          to the Senate, as commissioner to run the boundary between the <name type="place">U.
            States</name> and <name type="place">Mexico</name>, as stipulated by the Treaty of
          Peace, but that as he was a member of the Senate at the time the Treaty was ratified,
          objections had been made as to his constitutional eligibility to the appointment. I
          informed you, also, that in the event of <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr
              Sevier</name>
                    </hi>’s rejection, or the withdrawal of his nomination, I would send in
          your name, if you preferred it to a place on the Commission to adjudicate claims. My
          opinion was, that you would prefer to be at the Head of the Joint commission to adjudicate
          claims, to be commissioner to run the boundary, if indeed you would accept either. Such is
          still my opinion. My letter to you was sent to the Post Office last night. This morning a
          Telegraphic despatch has been recived in this City announcing the <hi rend="italics">death</hi> of <hi rend="italics">Senator <name type="person">Sevier</name>
                    </hi>.
          Another person should be nominated without delay. If I was certain you would accept, I
          would at once nominate you. On further reflection I think it extremely improbable
          <pb/>that you would accept. The commissioner whoever he may be, must set out in time to be
          at <hi rend="italics">San-Diego</hi> on the Pacific, on or before the 30th of May next,
          that being the time [lim]ited<note place="foot" n="1">Text here and below cut off side of
            page.</note> by the Treaty. Any Democrat who may be ap[p]ointed, might be recalled by my
          successor, immediately upon his accession to power, and in that [e]vent you might, be
          arrested on the journey by a recal, which would be extremely mortifying. I doubt too, when
          I come to give the subject more reflection, whether you could consent to be absent from
          your family, for so long a time as it would require to complete the duties, which it is
          estimated would probably be eighteen months. I have no means of communicating with you
          except by Telegraph, &amp; to adopt that mode would be to give publicity to the matter,
          here and elsewhere, and this you might possibly regard as prejudicial to you. Upon a full
          view of the whole subject I am so well satisfied that you would prefer the commission to
          adjudicate claims, which will set in Washington, that I think it unnecessary to wait to
          hear from you in regard to <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Sevier</name>’s</hi>
          place. As I mentioned to you in my letter of last night, the commission to adjudicate
          claims, will be in the nature of a judicial tribunal, and the persons appointed by me and
          confirmed by the Senate, would not probably be removed by my successor. Your family too
          could accompany you, and in the recss of the Sessions of the Board, the commissioners
          could visit their respective residenc[es]. In all respects it would be a more eligible
          position for one in your circumstances, than, to be commissioner to run the boundary. In
          conversation with some <pb/>members of Congress this morning, they assure me, that there
          can scarcely be a doubt but that Congress will at the present session, pass a law to
          create a Board of commissioners under the Treaty. A Bill they inform me has been reported
          and is now before Congress and no serious opposition to it, if any, is anticipated. I have
          been called upon by two Senators, since the news of <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Sevier</name>’</hi>s death wa[s] received, to urge me to make another nomination
          without delay, so as to give time for [. . .] person appointed to reach <hi rend="italics">San-Diego</hi> within [. . .] time limited in the Treaty. In view of all the
          circumstances, I shall probably make a nomination to the Senate on tomorrow, for
          commissioner to run the boundary.</p>
        <p>In coming this conclusion, I have consulted <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Majr.
              Graham</name> confidentially</hi>. He fully concurs with me in the views and opinions
          here expressed. He thinks that the commission to adjudicate claims, would suit you, while
          he is decidedly of opinion that the commission to run the boundary would-not, and that you
          could not &amp; would not accept the latter place. I should add that the salary of the two
          positions would be the same, while there will be no outfit for either. The commission to
          adjudicate claims will probably continue from two to three years.</p>
        <p>I shall be pleased to hear from you.</p>

        <salute>Honourable Sir,</salute>
        <p>I do believe that it is an uncommon thing for a Man in my humble sphere of life, to
          presume to address himself from <name type="place">Ireland</name>, to so Exalted a
          Personage, as the President, of the united States, of America, them Great and Prosperious
          States, the Lands of Glorious Liberty and fair Play—but the more humble I be, and the
          Greater the Personage, I address, the better chance I have to obtain the request I crave,
          when my Prayer, is ardent humble and Sincere.</p>
        <p>Honle. Sir, I am a Man of Excellent Character, and Regularly Bred to Agriculture,
          Gardening, and Botany, &amp;c. after Several years Experience, and much observation, under
          the auspicious of the Dublin Society, and in other Respectable places, which will appear
          by the Testimonials, in my possession. I have transacted the Business, of Land Steward,
          and Gardener, extensively, and has had from 60. to 170. Men daily, to oversee, Reclaming
          and Cropping Lands Ornamenting Gardens, and Pleasure Grounds, &amp;c. and Keeping accounts
          correctly. My Family consists of a Wife and two Daughters, I am 50 years of age strong and
          <pb/>healthy, my Wife is 46. one of my Daughters is 21. and the other 19 years of age,
          each of them understands the Dairy, and Landry<note place="foot" n="1">Duffy may have
            meant to write “Laundry” or may have invented an adjective for “land.”</note> Business
          &amp;c. are good plain Cooks, can work well at their Needle and Read and write, modest,
          Humble, willing and able to earn their Bread, honestly, but there is no earning to be had
          in Ireland, particularly for the last three years, it is geting worse every day, and is
          now I believe at the lowest Ebb, of Misery and Woe; I have transacted the business of
          Steward, and Gardener &amp;c. for <name type="person">Henry Blake</name>, Esqr. of this
          Place, for the last two years, Faithful, Honest, and Indifatiguably, attentive, he has
          given me three months notice of not requiring my services, which time will be up on the
          16th of March next, and in consequence of my having a Female Family, to support, all the
          reserve I could make would not support us three months, after I am disemployed, for in
          Ireland, there are four Idle for the one that is employed, and even that one on very low
            wages,<note place="foot" n="2">Because several sentence divisions in this letter are
            unclear, capital letters and periods have not been supplied.</note>
                </p>
        <p>Honble. Sir, what I most Humbly Crave, is, that you will Condescend, to order some
          Master, or Captain of an American Vessel, Trading to Ireland, to take me and the three
          Females to the united States of America, where we would earn a livlihood. We have good
          wearing apparel, some Feather Beds, and Bedding, with furniture for a Farm house, but not
          able to pay for our Passage, which I believe would amount to about £16., British Currency
          or 80 Dollars, American Currency, for the Voyage of four Persons, this we would earn
          honestly, on landing on moderate terms, and would not draw any wages, until our Expenses
          <pb/>would be cleared up, except Barely Subsistence that we could not avoid. Honble. sir,
          I have read your Message To Congress, last Month, at which I am delighted, and which
          Emboldens me to address myself to such Noble Principles, in this manner, for which I crave
          Pardon and do Humbly Crave Honble. Sir, that you will be pleased through your Humanity,
          and goodness to take my Case into consideration and Grant this my Request, which will be
          Gratefully acknowledged, in Hope of an answer I remain . . . .</p>

        <salute>My dear Uncle,</salute>
        <p>The January examination is past, but I am not satisfied with my standing at all, I really
          think I should have been higher, and I am sure there are men above me who do not know near
          so much about the course as I do &amp; they acknowlege it themselves. I stand 28th in
          Mathematics &amp; 30th in Ethics and I can safely say that I have never neglected one
          lesson and have always known my tasks before I entered the section room, so you see uncle
          it was not my fault that I did not stand higher. The box which you and aunt were kind
          enough to send me has not arrived yet, but I received a letter from Adams &amp; co saying
          it was at their office in <name type="place">New York</name> and I expect it in a day or
          two, when it comes I will acknowledge its receipt. I have managed to keep out of debt so
          far, but I have just received orders for a new coat &amp; a pair of winter pants,
          <pb/>which will make me a few dollars in debt. They sell every thing here at past twice
          its value, and with board &amp; washing $24 a month is very little. I have delayed writing
          for some time in hopes that the box would arrive so you will excuse this letter’s being
          late. Give my love to aunt Sallie and tell her that I am verry much obliged to her for the
          trouble she took in procuring my things for me. I am also very much obliged to you for
          Gov. Marcys permit to receive them, thanks to you I will have no trouble getting them when
          they come. Remember me to all.</p>

        <salute>Sir,</salute>
        <p>I have this day addressed a communication to the delegation in Congress, from this State,
          in relation to the Seminole Indians, still remaining within its limits.</p>
        <p>I have represented to them, what I believe to be indispensably necessary to the safety of
          our fellow citizens in the Southern division of the State. That is, the removal of these
          savages beyond the <name type="place">Mississippi</name>, or confining them within the
          limits assigned to them by <name type="person">Col. Worth</name>. This may be done by some
          half dozen military posts, partially across the Peninsula, with a complement of not more
          than 250 privates under the command of non-commissioned officers and a few others of
          higher grade. I do most respectfully request that this may be done; and this request is
          <pb/>made, from the conviction, that, without some such security, our Southern frontier
          may again be deluged in blood. Such a result to us is most obvious. These savages are not
          confined within their limits. They are thieves by nature. In their Expeditions beyond
          their limits, they steal the property of the whites. They (the Whites) have hitherto been
          restrained from inflicting immediate punishment on them, from the hope that the General
          Government would put a stop to this encroachment on their rights. If these wrongs are not
          redressed by the Government, they will not hesitate much longer to redress them without
          the aid of Government. The consequences may be readily anticipated. I do then, in the name
          and on behalf of my fellow citizens and of humanity itself, most earnestly request that
          this matter may not be postponed. </p>

        <p>My public engagements have prevented an earlier reply to your letter of the 18th ultimo.
          The article to which you refer, which appeared in the “Union” Newspaper, shortly after you
          resigned your seat in the <pb/>Senate in the summer of 1846, was the sole act of the
          Editor, as far as I know, and was certainly published without any agency of mine. I knew
          nothing of it, until I saw it in that paper. I regretted the publication of the article,
          and attributed it to the anxiety of <hi rend="italics">Mr Ritchie</hi> to save the
          tariff-bill of <date when="1846">1846</date>, and to the feeling of apprehension which,
          under the circumstances, he might very naturally entertain, that it might be defeated in
          consequence of your course. I disapproved its violence, and so express[e]d<note place="foot" n="1">Letter missing, light ink transfer.</note> myself at the time to
          yourself and others. You speak of the “Union,” as, “your (my) official Organ,” and say
          that the article referred to, “unatoned for, and unnoticed by the Editor since, has been
          erroneously considered by thousands as the approved, (perhaps authorized) condemnation of
          me and my character by the President himself,” and you ask “Are you willing that this
          shall be the case?” I am not sensible of ever having done you wrong. If I was, no man
          would be more anxious promptly to repair the injury. For erroneous impressions drawn by
          others, I am not responsible. <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr
            Ritchie</name>
                    </hi> has long conducted a public journal, is his own judge of what is
          proper to appear in his paper, and is alone responsible for it. If by the designation
          “official Organ,” which others as well as yourself have chosen to give to the “Union”
          Newspaper the idea is meant to be conveyed, that I supervise and direct its course, it is
          as I have often told yourself and others, a mistake. If by that designation, it be meant
          to convey the idea, that the “Union,” has given to the measures and general policy of my
          administration, an <pb/>uniform support, it is in that sense true, but this has been done
          upon the sole judgement and responsibility of the Editor. If because that paper happens to
          be published at the seat of Government and supports my administration, it is called my
          organ, or the organ of my administration, [I]<note place="foot" n="2">Text here and below
            either absent or cut off side of page.</note> am surely not accountable for what appears
          in its columns. It can hardly be expected that the President shall be required to express
          his dissent to articles in a newspaper, whi[ch] do not meet his views, whether relating to
          individuals or to public measures. If it w[ere] so, the President for his own protection,
          wou[ld] have to notice in an authorized form, any article which appeared in its columns,
          in which the facts assumed or the arguments used did not prcisely correspond with hi[s]
          own views. This would make the Presi[dent] virtually the Editor of the paper, a vocati[on]
          incompatible with his official station, [. . .] which he would have no time to pursue. Where
          “reason is left free to combat error,” as is the case in our country, no permanent injury
          can result to any citizen, whether in public or private life, from any abuse of the
          freedom of the press.</p>
        <p>I differed widely with you in opinion, as you know, upon the Tariff Bill of <date when="1846">1846</date>. Upon more than one occasion, I gave you my views upon the
          subject frankly, and without reserve, and you will remember how earnestly I endeavoured to
          convince you, of the great error, which in my judgement, you would commit, if you
          seperated yourself from the body of your political friends in Congress, and opposed its
          becoming a law. I had <pb/>no agency in causing you to resign your seat in the Senate. On
          the contrary I endeavoured to prevent it and deeply regretted it. When you did resign I
          thought you had committed a fatal political error. That the convictions under which you
          acted were honest, though mistaken, I did not doubt, and this opinion I freely expressed
          at the time to yourself and several of your friends; indeed to all with whom I conversed
          on the subject. I had known you from our college days, an[d] at the time of your
          resignation, and the appearance of the article in the “Union,” complained of, I believed
          you to be my friend an I certainly was yours. Several months after that time, from the

        <p>At the suggestion of our Board of Trustees and also, of several members of the Senate
          &amp; of the House of Representatives, I have the honour herewith of presenting the claims
          of our University to the charity of the public. It is our hope that we may receive the aid
          of the President, the Vice President, the members of the Cabinet &amp; the majority of the
          representatives of the people, and, that your Excellency will head the list for
          Washington.</p>
        <p>We aim in our military studies to be equal to West Point—in our other studies to take the
          highest rank among the Educational Institutions of our Country—to give our young men such
          a development of moral, intellectual &amp; physical power as shall enable them to
          discharge <pb/>most faithfully all their duties to their Country &amp; the world.</p>

        <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
        <p>From your letter of the 10th &amp; what I see in the Telegrapic accounts it is now
          useless to say any thing about the appointment to run the boundary under the <name type="place">Mexican</name> Treaty—as to the adjudication of the claims against <name type="place">Mexico</name>, the Law has not yet passd. &amp; if it is, it will probably
          be too late in the Session for you to make the appointments without subjecting yourself to
          the charge of indelicacy, thereby laying a foundation for a plausible pretext for removing
          the incumbents. If these were prominent politicians hot from the recent canvass like
          Weller &amp; myself, the guillotine would be almost certain. But if not removed we should
          stand like post-mortem relics of a past admininistration, lingering out, with longing
          anxiety for office their allotted time.</p>

        <salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>Before I received your letter of the 29th ultimo, I had written to you and had
          anticipated the request you make, that I would give you my advice, whether you had better
          resign on the <date when="--03-04">4th of March</date>, or await your recal, should it be
          the pleasure of the President Elect to recal you.<note place="foot" n="1">
                        <name type="person">Polk</name> to <name type="person">Bancroft</name>, <date when="1849-01-05">January 5, 1849</date>.</note> It was, and is, my decided opinion,
          that you should not voluntarily relinquish your mission. In my letter I assigned the
          reasons for this opinion. I may add that you have been eminently successful in all the
          negotiations entrusted to you, and the whole country, of all parties, are abundantly
          satisfied that an abler and more faithful Representative could not succeed you. Your <hi rend="italics">postal Treaty</hi>, and your successful efforts to procure the release of
          American citizens imprisoned in Ireland, are very popular throughout the country, and your
          recal could be attributed to no other cause, than that you belong to a different political
          party, than that of the President elect. That the next Administration will be
          proscriptive, notwithstanding the protestations to the contrary before the election I do
          not doubt; still I doubt whether you will be disturbed, at all events during the early
          part of the next term. Should I be mistaken in this, your <pb/>recal could do you no
          possible injury.</p>
        <p>I thank you for the <hi rend="italics">Mecklenburg papers</hi> which you seent to
            me.<note place="foot" n="2">
                        <name type="person">Polk</name> refers to the enclosures in

          <hi rend="italics">Gov. Swain</hi> President of the University of <name type="place">N.
            Carolina</name>, I see has communicated to the Governor of that state, a letter from
          you, and a portion, (perhaps all) the papers, which you sent to me. The Governor laid them
          before the Legislature and your letter to <name type="person">Mr <hi rend="italics">Swain</hi>
                    </name> has been published. Your agency in bringing these papers to light
          has rendered you very popular in <name type="place">N. Carolina</name> and indeed in all
          the Southern states. The <hi rend="italics">main paper</hi> connected with the proceedings
          of the people of Mecklenburg you have not given. It is the formal <hi rend="italics">Declaration of Independence itself</hi>, which was adopted on the <date when="1775-05-20">20th May 1775</date>. This paper was forwarded to the General Congress
          at <name type="place">Philadelphia</name>, by <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Capt.
              Jack</name>

                    </hi> in his despatch to the Home Government, which
          you have sent to me refers to it. In his Proclamation issued I believe in the autumn of
            <date when="1775">1775</date>, when the Governor was on board the ship, to sail for
          England, denounces it as treasonable. The Resolves which you have sent to me, were passed
          a few weeks after, the formal <hi rend="italics">Declaration of Independence</hi> was
          made. This Declaration was doubtless transmitted or carried in person to England by
          Governor <name type="person">Martin</name>. If it is to be found in the Brittish Archives,
          it will be conclusive evidence of the fact of such Declaration having been made, a fact,
          which <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Jefferson</name>
                    </hi> more than doubted. I
          dislike to trouble you further on the subject, but must request that you will cause a
          further <pb/>search to be made for the <hi rend="italics">Declaration</hi> of <date when="1775-05-20">May 20" 1775</date>, which is the main-paper and the leading
          proceeding of the patriotic people of Mecklenburg. To aid you in any further researches,
          you may have it in your power to make, I enclose you extracts of two letters, which I have
          received on the subject from <hi rend="italics">

          and as several of its members, participated actively in the proceedings in <name type="place">Mecklenburg</name>, he desires to shew their connection with, the
          intresting events, which took place in <name type="place">Mecklenburg</name>. To me the
          subject is peculiarly intresting, for though the <hi rend="italics">vile slander</hi>
          which was heaped upon the memory of my Grandfather, in the Presidential canvass of <date when="1844">1844</date>, has been sufficiently refuted by other testimony, yet every
          thing which establishes the authenticity of the Mecklenburg proceedings, will tend, still
          more clearly to put to shame the revilers of his memory. I have now in my possession a
          printed copy of the Journal of “The Provincial Congress” of <abbr>S.C.</abbr> of
            [which]<note place="foot" n="4">

                        <name type="person">Ezekiel Polk</name>
                    </hi>
          (my Grandfather) was a member. By that Congress he was appointed a <hi rend="italics">Captain</hi>, and I have in my possession his original commission on par[c]hment,<note place="foot" n="5">Letter inserted to complete probable meaning.</note> under which he
          served in the Revolutionary War. He represented a District in “The Provincial Congress,”
          of <abbr>S.C.</abbr>, adjoining <pb/>Mecklenburg, and was present, at Charlotte, &amp; was
          among those who adopted “the Declaration of Independance” on the <date when="1775-05-20">20th of May 1775</date>. The copy of the Journal which I have, was sent to me by an
          aged man in <name type="place">N. Carloina</name> since I have been President, who stated
          to me in a letter which accompanied it, that he had found it among the old papers of his
          father, who was also a member of the Provincial Congress.<note place="foot" n="6">
                        <name type="person">Isaac T. Avery</name> to <name type="person">Polk</name>, <date when="1846-01-21">January 21, 1846</date>.</note> He sent it to me as containing a
          conclusive refutation of the slander, which the recklessness of party had invented against
          the memory of <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Ezekiel Polk</name>
                    </hi>, for the
          purpose of injuriously affecting his Grandson, when a candidate for the Presidency. The
          copy of the Journal which I have, is a small printed pamphet, &amp; is the only one I have
          ever heard of. As it is probable that but few copies were printed, it may be the only copy
          now to be found. It is a curious as well as a valuable document. It may possibly be of use
          to you, in the further preperation of your history, and if so, I will furnish you with the
          original or an exact copy of it, should you desire it.</p>

        <salute>Dear Marshall</salute>
        <p>I have just examined the Official Report of the Semi-Annual examination of the cadets, of
          the Military Academy, and find that you stand, in your class No. 28. in Mathematics, No.
            3[0].<note place="foot" n="1">Number may, alternately, be “36.”</note> in English
          Grammar, and No. 26 in “general merit.[”]<note place="foot" n="2">Closing quotation mark
            missing.</note> I deem it proper to say to you, that I consider your standing reputable
          and I do not complain of it, though I would have been much gratified if it had been
          better. I hope you will be studious and attentive to all your duties, and thus secure for
          yourself a higher No. at the next examination. I am satisfied that if you resolve to do
          so, you can obtain a better standing. The Report of your “conduct,” for the month of
          December which has been made to me by the Engineer Department,<note place="foot" n="3">Report and cover letter, if any, probably from <name type="person">Joseph G.
              Totten</name>, not found.</note> represents you to have received 8. Demerit mks. This
          is a decided improvement over the preceding month. I hope that your “conduct” Report for
          the future will present that few Demerits, if not a clean sheet. Nothing is easier than to
          avoid them altogether. This I aver from experience, for during my whole College course I
          was never charged with the neglect of a single duty. The same thing I believe may be said
          of your father. It is only necessarry that you should come to a fixed <pb/>determination
          in your own mind, in order to avoid the Demerits altogether. From the last Report sent to
          me, your whole number of Demerits since the commencement of the Academic year, 68. Upon
          the whole I am pretty well dis[sa]t[is]fied<note place="foot" n="4">Letters inserted to
            complete probable meaning.</note> with your progress thus far, and the remarks I have
          made, are made in the hope that you will see the necessity of devoting yourself with
          increased diligence to your duties.</p>
        <p>I have recived your letter of the 13th Instant. When the Box, wich was forwarded to you

          you must acknowledge its receipt. You must avoid going in debt and live upon your pay. The
          regulations of the Academy, which prohibit a Cadet, from receivg money or any other
          supplies from his parents or from any other person, without special permission, are
          stringent and very properly so. The articles which were forwarded to you by your aunt,
          would not have been sent, if it had not been apprehended, that you might not have taken a
          proper supply with you when you entered the Academy. Hereafter you must took<note place="foot" n="5">

        <salute>My Dear Sir.</salute>
        <p>Some of your goods arrived to day at this place on their way to <name type="place">Nashville</name>, and I regret to inform you that in passing the mountains the waggon
          containing them upset and broke the boxes so that four of them were open or had to be
          opened from their damaged condition upon their arrival here. All of the paintings however
          I am happy to say are said to be entirly uninjured. The frames around your own and <name type="person">Mrs Polk</name>’s portraits are very much injured, and from what I could
          gather may be considered as destroyed. The frame around the battle-piece, supposed to be
          Chapultepec is also much injured. The engraving of the scene on the cost<note place="foot" n="1">Thompson probably meant to write “coast.”</note> of Africa has a rent, and some of
          the glasses covering the pictures are broken. A box of books and papers was also split. I
          called down at <name type="person">Messers Black</name> &amp; <name type="person">Knox</name>’s as soon as I heard of the matter but they had had every thing repacked. I
          doubt not but that all has been done by them which could be done to protect you and secure
          the safe transmission of the goods from this point. The damages assessed by the Board of
          Trade is twenty five dollars.</p>
        <p>It is a matter of gratulation that the paintings may all be <pb/>considered safe, for
          these if injured or destroyed could not be easily restored, more especially as they may
          well be supposed to derive peculiar interest from the circumstances of their execution and
          their connection with your administration—an administration which will have more character
          in a century than it has to day, the solid renown of which will increase, as the future
          unfolds the value of the great gifts you have given to our country.</p>
        <p>Be pleased to remember me to <name type="person">Mrs Polk</name>, and say to her that her
            <hi rend="italics">representative</hi> was very much admired and more for the character
          in the likeness than the work of the artist. Those who had never seen <name type="person">Mrs Polk</name> were struck with the qualities of mind and character which the portrait
          exhibited and I doubt not they would like to have a rival worthy of her at the
          Mansion.</p>
        <p>Permit me to thank you for the copy of your last message. It was suited to the time and
          occasion. It was a <hi rend="italics">resume</hi> of the democratic faith, associated with
          our past history, connected with the active interests and feelings of the present, and
          presenting the only code of principles around which any party of republicans can safely
          unite for the future. When I thank you for that document I but convey to you the universal
          sentiment of the great mass of the people.</p>
        <p>I am devoting what spare time I can seize to the execution of my historical work, but it
          will require a long time for its completion.</p>

        <p>waiting for Lord P.</p>
        <p>Here I am, after a very hard day’s work, waiting at the Foreign Office for Lord
          Palmerston. The Irish business, I thought, well &amp; finally <pb/>settled; but as <name type="person">Mr Buchanan</name> has reopened it, I most earnestly hope you will be
          satisfied with my protesting note which is rather a declaration or remonstrance. If you
          are satisfied, let it appear on the public record in <name type="person">Buchanan</name>’s
          note.</p>
        <p>The Mecklenburg papers you will have received.<note place="foot" n="1">Enclosures in
              <name type="person">Bancroft</name> to <name type="person">Polk</name>, <date when="1848-12-29">December 29, 1848</date>; see <name type="person">Polk</name> to

              1849</date>, in which <name type="person">Polk</name> enclosed them.</note> I hope
          they are what you wanted.</p>
        <p>And now can you send me an opinion on what I consider by far the most important matter in
          discussion, the repeal of the Navigation Laws. I have been diligently pursuing the
          subject, &amp; hope almost to get a treaty into some shape or well under-weigh before the
            <date when="--03-04">4th of March</date>.</p>
        <p>The ministry are alarmed about the coming debate. They ask me what have you to give for
          our colonial trade? They state our separate states are as colonies. We ought to allow them
          to trade from port to port on our shores, if they allow us to trade from Kingdom to their
          colonies. In a word, as the offer now stands it is abrogation of the Navigation laws with
          Great Britain for all but the coasting trade, &amp; abrogation of them altogether coasting
          trade &amp; all for the colonies. This, I think, would do away with the colonial system
            <hi rend="italics">in toto</hi>, &amp; make the colonies virtually independent. It would
          open to our people all the trade on Lake Ontario, &amp; all the trade down the St.
          Lawrence. Think of this &amp; write me a letter about it. I meant to have written to <name type="person">Mr Buchanan</name> about it today, but have had no time. And pray say to
            <name type="person">Mr Johnson</name> I wanted very much to send him a private letter,
          but I have not had a moment.</p>
        <p>
                    <pb/>This [render]<note place="foot" n="2">Word uncertain, ink blot.</note> of the
          Navigation Acts is of the utmost importance; and will be a most creditable thing to us
          all, to your administration if we can get it into shape during your presidency.</p>
        <p>As to resigning I have not decided yet. I have many things which press upon me strongly
          &amp; require my early return to America.</p>
        <p>As to California unless you take some steps, it will be filled with fugitives from <name type="place">Europe</name>. Emigrants are rushing there, not from this island only, but
          from the continent. It is a bad thing to admit foreigners before our Govt. is established.
          English capital &amp; English adventurers will bring the gold to <name type="place">England</name>.</p>

          a new wild country and a person ought to be paid for going there at this time. I have

        <p>There is nothing in this state worth your attention. The country is improveing verry

        <salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>I am greatly obliged to you for your letter of the 24th Instant. The accident which
          happened to the wagon containing my Boxes, was most unfortunate, and must have been the
          result of culpable negligence. My greatest solicitude now is, to know, that my <hi rend="italics">manuscipt papers</hi>, which were distributed in several of the Boxes,
          and some of which were of a confidential character &amp;, <hi rend="italics">to me</hi>
          most valuable, are safe. You inform me that “a box of books &amp; papers was split.” I
          hope if any of the <hi rend="italics">manuscipts</hi> were exposed to view, that they fell
          into honourable hands, and that they were safely repacked. From the character of <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Messrs Black</name> &amp; <name type="person">Knox</name>
                    </hi> I have no doubt, so far as they are concerned, they were in safe
          hands. My only <pb/>apprehension is, that others, who may have been <hi rend="italics">curious</hi>, had access to them in their exposed condition. I regret that Messrs. <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Black</name> &amp; <name type="person">Knox</name>
                    </hi>, when they received the goods in their damaged condition, permitted
          any part of them to be exposed to the public view, but doubtless they saw no impropriety
          in it. I fear too, that persons may have had access to the contents of the Boxes, at the
          place where the accident happened to the wagon, and before they came into the possession
          of Messrs. <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Black</name> &amp; <name type="person">Knox</name>
                    </hi>. My papers were put up rather loosely in the Boxes supposing that
          they would be perfectly safe, until I opened them myself at <name type="place">Nashville</name>. They were the accumulation of my four years term; were extensive,
          &amp; too heavy to be carried with my personal baggage on my return to Tennessee. I have
          heard nothing from <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Messrs Black</name> &amp; <name type="person">Knox</name>
                    </hi>. I beg that you will do me the favour to see them, and
          ascertain from them, at <hi rend="italics">what place</hi> the accident occurred; whose
          the wagon was, and whether any of the manuscript papers were exposed at the time of the
          accident, &amp; before he reached Wheeling. Though the Boxes contained other articles, of
          value, my greatest anxiety is to prove that <hi rend="italics">all</hi> my papers are
          safe.</p>

          Representatives of the <date when="1848-12-20">20th of December 1848</date>.<note place="foot" n="2">Enclosures, not found, consisted of a chart of money collected by
              <abbr>U.S.</abbr> Navy officers at occupied Mexican ports and two charts of that
            money’s disbursement. The first two charts total the money collected at $131,835.79; the
            third gives this figure as $131,835.77 and, near the end, notes an additional $66,683.55
            that navy officers received from the <abbr>U.S.</abbr> Army’s collectors at Veracruz and
            Tampico. See the charts in House Executive Document No. 47, 30th Congress, 2nd Session,
            pp. 110–20.</note> These statements show the amount of moneys &amp; property received
          during the late war with the <name type="place">Republic of Mexico</name>, at the
          different ports of entry, or in any other way within her limits, by Naval Officers; they
          also show the manner in which the same has been expended, so far as settlements have been
          made.</p>
        <p>Of the contributions collected in the Pacific by Naval officers, no account has yet been
          received &amp; adjusted. The principal collections were made at <name type="place">Mazatlan</name>, by the Purser of the Razee, Independence. His accounts will not be
          adjusted until the return of that ship to the United States, sometime in the coming
          Spring. I have no reason to suppose that any other collections of any considerable amount
          were made by Naval officers in the Pacific.</p>

        <p>A poor boy, one who has accumulated something by unceasing industry and selfdenial
          addresses you.</p>
        <p>An answer to two or three questions which I am about to propose will <hi rend="italics">make</hi> or mar (if such an expression may be used) my isolated fortunes.</p>
        <p>I have some three hundred dollars, and also, the <name type="place">California</name>

          besides myself is going from this place.</p>
        <p>To speak candidly, I can’t give credence to the “Democratic” papers even, however zealous
          in procuring the latest official intelligence, however <hi rend="italics">candid</hi> the

        <salute>
                    <pb/>Dear Sir.</salute>
        <p>In reply to your letter of the 27" inst, I have the pleasure of saying, that from
            <name type="person">Mr Black</name> I learned that the two boxes containing your books
          and papers, although split and injured when they arrived here, did not exhibit the
          slightest evidence of having been opened or that any of the contents had been touched or
          that any of them could have well escaped from the boxes. The principal box, as I had
          observed myself, which was said to contain books and papers was considerably split, but
            <name type="person">Mr Black</name> informs me as the younger <name type="person">Mr
            Knox</name> did at the time, that every thing was safe in it, and it was made entirely
          secure for further transportation. <name type="person">Mr Black</name> seems very
          confidant that every thing in that box is entrely safe. The contents were not seen by any
          one and I think you need not feel any solicitude as to their privacy and safety. From all
          I can learn you may rest quite satisfied that you will find all right in relation to the
          books &amp; papers.</p>
        <p>The waggoners name is <name type="person">Joseph Sumption</name>. The accident is said to
          have occurred by the breaking down of the hind wheel of the waggon, which occurred as he
          stated in the neighborhood of a toll gate, <hi rend="italics">where</hi>, I could not
          learn; that the goods were unloaded, the waggon righted up and re-loaded at the time.</p>
        <p>The only boxes exposed to view, as to their contents, were those having the portraits and
          pictures and these were exposed for the purpose of procuring the assessment of damages,
          which I doubt not, <name type="person">Messrs <pb/>Black</name> &amp; <name type="person">Knox</name> felt themselves called upon, <hi rend="italics">professionally</hi>, to do,
          by the condition of the boxes. The gentleman say that nothing else was exposed to view or
          handled except the box containing the copiying press, which was only opened and seemed
          safe and instantly reclosed. No books or papers were touched and the boxes containing them
          secured against the injuries incurred, so as to make them safe for the balance of the way.
          On the 29" inst they were shipped on the Steamer Geneva dirct for <name type="place">Nashville</name>.</p>
        <p>Should you send any more goods before you leave, if you will inform me of the probable
          time of their arrival here I will, if possible, see to them.</p>
        <p>I fear I shall not be able to see you on your return through this place as I will
          probably be absent on the circuit in discharge of the duties of my office, as my <hi rend="italics">case</hi> will not be reached before that time. Should I be at home I
          will be pleased to see <name type="person">Mrs Polk</name> &amp; yourself and in my
          absence <name type="person">Mrs Thompson</name> will be at home.</p>

        <note>
          <p>[<abbr>P.S.</abbr>] Having leisure since writing the foregoing, I have seen <name type="person">Col Knox</name> and the porter who aided in unloading the waggon, and I
            am still more satisfied in the conclusion, that every thing of the kind you refer to is
            safe. The box I spoke of split between the ends of the hoops, which did not meet around
            it; <name type="person">Col Knox</name> opened the box &amp; found the folds of the
            packing paper undisturbed and reclosed and secured it. This would seem to make the
            conclusion satisfactory. <name type="person">Geo W. Thompson</name>

        <salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>I thank you for your letter of the 31st in answer to mine of the 27th ultimo. I am now
          perfectly satisfied that my books and papers, which were in the boxes which were injured,
          by the accident which happened to the wagon containing them are safe. After I wrote to you
          my Private Secretary (<name type="person">Col. Walker</name>) received a letter from <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Messrs Black</name> &amp; <name type="person">Knox</name>
                    </hi> giving him information of the accident. They inform him that the
          wagoner (whom they represent to be an honest and very poor man) requested that a part of
          the damages which had been assessed against him might be remitted and refunded to him. I
          immediately directed <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Col. Walker</name>
                    </hi> to
          enclose to <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Messrs Black</name> &amp; <name type="person">Knox</name>
                    </hi> the whole amount of the damages, ($25.00) and request
          them to hand it to the wagoner and he did so. The accident may have been unavoidable, and
          I was unwilling that the poor wagoner should lose his wages in consequence of it.</p>

        <salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
        <p>As this is the last packet which will carry a letter from this place, which can reach you
          before the <date when="--03-04">4h of March</date>, pardon me for asking a decision upon
          the application of my son <name type="person">John</name>, who has been so much flattered
          with the idea of entering the Navy as a Midshipman, by <name type="person">Capt
            Paulding</name> &amp; other officers, that he is almost crazy about it.</p>
        <p>I am sorry that the crisis at <name type="place">Frankfort</name> has not terminated in
          time for your administration to have the benefit of the Treaty which will follow, if the
          new German Constitution goes into effect. But affairs there still remain doubtful and
          perplexing, and the Treaty will probably pass into other hands than mine. I sent <name type="person">Mr. Fay</name> with <name type="person">Com. Parker</name> and he has not
          yet returned from <name type="place">Frankfort</name>, but the latter returns to America
          on the 10h inst, with impression which he will communicate to you.</p>
        <p>Your letter to the King in behalf of Baron Gerolt<note place="foot" n="1">Letter to <name type="person">Frederick William IV</name>, <name type="place">Prussia</name>’s king,
            not found.</note> is not yet presented: because the Minister of Foreign affaires has not
          yet answered my application for an audience. I cannot conceive a motive for refusing this
          audience, but the delay seems to imply that there is some importance attached to the
          circumstance, which I may not understand. I refer to it that you &amp; <name type="person">Mr. Buchanan</name> may notice more particularly what passes with Baron von
          Rœ̈nne.</p>
        <p>
                    <name type="person">Count Badene</name> has the office copy of the letter, and he has
          intimated that it was not customary as a matter of etiquette, to go through the formality
          of an audience with the King, on such subjects. I <pb/>have desired him to say so in
          writing, and if he does I shall not insist on presenting it in person: but unless he puts
          the application on this ground I shall be bound to ask further instructions from the
          Department.</p>
        <p>I give you joy that the day is so near when you will be relieved from all such vexations,
          and when you can look from the bosom of your retirement without solicitude upon the petty
          formalities of office. May you &amp; <name type="person">Mrs. Polk</name> have a long life
          of happiness is the sincere prayer of . . . .</p>

        <salute>Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>I have received your letter of the 19th ultimo, and now regret that I made to you the
          suggestion contained in my letters of the 9th and 10th ultimo, for surely nothing was
          further from my thoughts, than to say or do any thing which could cause your “pride” to
          “revolt,” or to give you either pain or offence. I do not at present reply to some other
          remarks in your letter, which I am sure, upon further reflection, you must see are unjust
          towards me, and to the motives of sincere regard which induced me to write to you. Our
          common friend <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Majr. Graham</name>
                    </hi>, to whom I
          showed my letter of the 10th, concurred with me in opinion, and approved the suggestion
          made in that letter. Your letter addressed to me last summer<note place="foot" n="1">
                        <name type="person">Brown</name> to <name type="person">Polk</name>, <date when="1848-07-12">July 12</date> and c. <date when="1848-07-25">July 25, 1848</date>.</note>
          <pb/>greatly surprised me. That letter reached me near the close of the Session of
          Congress, when I was much occupied in the performance of my public duties; still I might
          have answered it, and given a full, and as I think a satisfactory explanation of all the
          matters referred to in it. This I thought it best to do in person, as I fully intended,
          when we should meet. For the same reason I postpone for the present a reply to that
          letter. You and I have been old and constant friends, and I am not conscious of ever
          having given you just cause of displeasure. I am unwilling to believe it possible that
          these relations, which have so long existed between us, can now be changed. Certainly they
          will not be, by any act of mine.</p>

        <p>I have stated in my despatch to the Department the substance of my interview with the
          King when presenting your letter in behalf of <name type="person">Baron
            <pb/>Gerolt</name>.<note place="foot" n="1">Letter to <name type="person">Frederick
              William IV</name> not found.</note> It was most gratifying to yourself personally as
          well as to our Country. No certain promise was given to restore <name type="person">Baron
            Gerolt</name> to the Diplomatic service, but the King declared that he had a high
          opinion of his merits, and valued highly the testimonial he possessed from you.</p>

        <salute>Dear Mother:</salute>
        <p>It has been more than four years since I left Tennessee. They have been years of
          unceasing labour and anxiety, and of high public responsibility. I am heartily rejoiced
          that my Presidential term is so near its close. I am sure that I will enjoy the quiet of
          retirement and the rest which I so much need. I expect to leave Washington for Tennessee
          on the 6th of March, taking the Southern route, by the way of <name type="place">Charleston</name> and <name type="place">New Orleans</name>, and will probably reach
            <name type="place">Nashville</name> about the <date when="--03-25">25th of March</date>.
          We will make but a very short stop at <name type="place">Nashville</name>, and proceed at
          once to <name type="place">Columbia</name>, where I hope to find you in the enjoyment of
          good health. My <pb/>own health and that of my household continue to be good.</p>
        <p>I write simply, to apprise you of my movements at the close of my term.</p>
        <p>Your affectionate Son</p>

        <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
        <p>I this morning recd. yours of the 6th Inst. after I had despatched one to <name type="person">Cave Johnson</name> on the subject on which yours is written. It is not
          possible for you to be more unwilling than I am for any thing to occur calculated to mar
          that friendship to which you refer as having so long existed between us. To avoid writing
          any more about it &amp; thereby keep the avenues of friendship the wider open until your
          return &amp; an opportunity for a fuller understanding of each other’s views &amp;
          feelings, I prefer refering you to that letter, with the assurances that if in aught I
          have written to him I have done you injustice or wrong of any sort, I shall at all times
          be more than ready &amp; willing to repair it. I am free to admit that I may not have
          allways been sufficiently aware of the <pb/>embarrassments which have surrounded you,
          whilst I think your own candor must also allow that you may not have sufficiently
          appreciated the trying difficulties &amp; perplexities through which I have had to pass
          during your absence from the State. I think if you will refer to my letter<note place="foot" n="1">
                        <name type="person">Brown</name> to <name type="person">Polk</name>,
              <date when="1849-01-19">January 19, 1849</date>.</note> you will find the words which
          you have marked as a quotation, used not in reference to the position indicated in your
          letter—not to the <hi rend="italics">offer</hi> of that position, for whilst I felt bound
          to decline it, I certainly did not intend to take exceptions to the tender. But in giving
          my reasons for declining it I allude to the probability of removal by the new
          President—then if I escaped the guillotine, I referd. to the odious light in which I might
          be viewd in the City by the <hi rend="italics">new comers</hi>, who would look upon me as
          a sort of spy, holding me therefore at a distance &amp; making my residence in the city
          any thing but agreeable either to me or my family. It was in tracing out these
          disagreeable consequences as reasons for declining your offer that I think I used those
          expressions—it was certainly only in that way that I intended their application—for I did
          not suppose you had taken time to trace out these matters or to consider much, if at all,
          these points of personal sensitiveness to which acceptance might expose me.</p>
        <p>Regretting of course that any thing should have occured to make such a correspondence as
          this necessary for the first time in our lives. . . .</p>

        <salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>When you were here a few weeks ago, you requested me to inform you of the route I would
          travel, on my return to my residence in <name type="place">Tennessee</name>, after the
          close of my Presidential term. I expect to leave here on the <date when="--03-06">6th of
            March</date>, and have concluded to take the route which you recommended. I will go from
            <hi rend="italics">Charleston</hi> to <hi rend="italics">Savannah</hi> and thence to <hi rend="italics">Macon</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Barnesville</hi>. At the latter place I
          understand I will have to leave the <hi rend="italics">Georgia Rail Road</hi> and travel
          in a stage coach [conveyance]<note place="foot" n="1">Word or words uncertain, light ink
            transfer.</note> to the nearest point on the <hi rend="italics">Montgomery Rail
            Road</hi>. It will be desireable to the ladies of my family to avoid night travelling,
          and with this view I have spoken to the Post Master General to make an arrangement if
          practicable, with the rail conductor, to furnish me with an extra coach, to be under my
          control.</p>
        <p>I saw <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Genl. Haralson</name>
                    </hi> this morning, but
          was not then, prepared to give him a positive answer on the subject in which you take a
          personal interest. It gives me pleasure now to say to you, that I can gratify your
          <pb/>wishes by the appointment of your son as a Cadet, in the Military Academy at West
          Point. The appointment of Cadets will not take place, until the last week of my term.</p>

        <salute>Respected friend,</salute>
        <p>Before this letter reaches your hand the memorable administration over which it has been
          your fortune to preside, will have closed, leaving to the Country, as a perpetual memory
          of its glorious period, a new empire, larger, richer, more fertile than that which, the
          Rome of the Consuls, and that of the Casars, conquered during five centuries; An Empire
          obtained in a just defensive war, which did not last more than one year, and at the
          expence, only, of a debt not equal to one fifth of the <pb/>annual peace-budget of
          France.</p>
        <p>In the home to which you will soon return, that where I sat at your hospitable board, you
          will find, in the proud consciousness of having fulfilled all that the Democracy expected
          at your hand, when it’s delegates, at Baltimore, proclaimed you it’s Candidate, and in the
          gratitude of American Democrates, the only reward you ever sought, or would accept.</p>
        <p>Allow me, respected friend, to add to these felicitations on your well earned renown,
          addressed to the first Magistrate but, which, in all probability, will be read by the
          private Citizen, my fervent wishes that your future life may be as happy as your public
          career has been fortunate to our Common Country.</p>
        <p>Will you have the goodness, Sir, to present me, most respectfully, to <name type="person">Mrs. Polk</name>, and to receive the assurances of the sincere esteem with which I have

        <salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>
                    <pb/>I have received your letter of the 6th Instant, informing me that you have collected
          for me, for rents and for lands sold, <hi rend="italics">six hundred and sixty five
            dollars ($665.00)</hi>, and enquiring what disposition I desire to have made of it. If
          you have an opportunity, and can purchase an additional hand and a mule for me, and send
          them to my plantation in <name type="place">Mississippi</name> it would suit me best. My
          manager (<hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr John A. Marrs</name>
                    </hi>) informs me
          that he has near 100. acres of land open, more than his present force can cultivate this
            year.<note place="foot" n="1">
                        <name type="person">Polk</name> possibly refers to <name type="person">John A. Mairs</name> to <name type="person">Polk</name>, <date when="1848-01-04">January 4, 1848</date>.</note> If you can make the purchase, I
          desire that it shall be done in time for this year’s crop. For the reasons stated in my
          correspondence with you two or three years ago, it will be unnecessary that you should
          make it known that you are purchasing for me.<note place="foot" n="2">

              <date when="1846-12-22">December 22, 1846</date>.</note> You can take the title in
          your own name and transfer it to me as you did in a former case. I wish the same
          description of property you then bought; I mean young and effective. If you purchase you
          can employ some trust-worthy man to take the property down, writing yourself a letter to
            <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Marrs</name>
                    </hi>. If the price should be
          either greater or less, than the amount in your hands, we can settle it hereafter.</p>
        <p>In answer to the enquiries you make in relation to the time of my return home; whether I
          will visit my plantation in the Spring &amp;c I have to state, that I expect to leave here
          on the <date when="--03-06">6th of March</date>, taking the Southern route, by way <hi rend="italics">Charleston</hi>, <hi rend="italics">Mobile</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italics">New Orleans</hi>. This will of course bring me by the way of <hi rend="italics">Memphis</hi> on my way up the river, at which point, if you have any business there, I
          should be happy to visit you. It is <pb/>impossible to say, on what day I may pass <hi rend="italics">Memphis</hi>, but as I may meet with some detentions on the route, it
          will probably be about the <date when="--03-22">22nd</date> or <date when="--03-23">23rd
            of March</date>. I cannot tell until I reach home, whether I will visit my plantation in
          the Spring or not. If I do I will certainly spend a day or two with my relations in
          Bolivar.</p>
        <p>I am sincerely rejoiced as the period approach[es]<note place="foot" n="3">Letters
            missing, light ink transfer.</note> when I will be relieved, from public cares and
          responsibilities. I will very soon cease to be a <hi rend="italics">servant</hi> and
          become a <hi rend="italics">sovereign</hi>. I am very sure that as a pivate citizen,
          exercising a part of the sovereign power of my country, I shall have more contentment and

        <salute>My Dear Uncle,</salute>
        <p>The box which you &amp; aunt were so kind as to send me arrived yesterday and every thing
          agreed with the memorandum which accompany your letter.<note place="foot" n="1">List of
            items, not found, enclosed in <name type="person">Polk</name> to <name type="person">Marshall T. Polk, Jr.</name>, <date when="1849-01-01">January 1, 1849</date>.</note>
          The contents of the said box were very welcome, for I never saw such cold weather in my
          life. I nearly freeze sitting in my room by the fire. The wind comes in at the door &amp;
          window just as if there <pb/>was nothing to prevent it. I suppose the next letter I
          address to you will have to be directed to the ex President; I am glad your term has
          expired, for I used think you looked troubled with the press of business which was put
          upon you. All the good democrats say that you have done more good for the country in your
          term than any Pres. for a long time. I am doing better in my studies now than I did before
          January but I will stand lower in general merit in June than I do now, &amp; all on
          account of my demerit. I did hope to send you a blank report this month but I got 8
          demerit for allowing visiting whilst I was sentinel. The cadet visited without my
          knowledge, he was in the room when I was posted &amp; I did not see him, but the
          Commandant would not accept my excuse, so I had to take the demerit. I will make another
          trial to get them off by going to the Superintendent. Marshall Walker sends his love to
          all. Tell aunt Sallie she must write to me before long.</p>

        <salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
        <p>I had intended to have written you a long letter today, but I must delay it to the next
          Steamer, when I shall have looked once more at the <name type="place">North
            Carolina</name> papers.</p>
        <p>My object in writing today is to enclose to you a translation of an article that appeared
          in the Journal des Débats in Paris during my stay there.<note place="foot" n="1">Enclosure
            not found. Bancroft most likely refers to an untitled and unsigned article in the Paris
              <hi rend="italics">Journal des débats politiques et littéraires</hi> of <date when="1849-02-07">February 7, 1849</date>. It describes, with both awe and skepticism,
            reports carried by steamship of the amounts of gold and mercury discovered in <name type="place">California</name>, “le nouvel [the new] Eldorado,” and the thousands of
            people headed there. Lamenting the gold-seekers’ abandonment of law and morality, the
            article quotes a letter, published in <name type="place">New York</name> newspapers, in
            which <name type="person">Cdre. Thomas</name> ap <name type="person">C. Jones</name>
            reports his decision not to land at <name type="place">San Francisco</name> to restore
            order because he believes that men sent ashore would desert. (The article describes the
            letter as written to the <abbr>U.S.</abbr> secretary of war, but it most likely refers
            to—though misquotes—Jones’s letter about the potential for desertion, dated <date when="1848-11-02">November 2, 1848</date>, to Secretary of the <name type="person">Navy John Y. Mason</name>. An extract from that letter appeared in papers including
            the <name type="place">New York</name>
            <hi rend="italics">Herald</hi> of <date when="1849-01-23">January 23,
            1849</date>.)</note> Its author is a friend of mine; &amp; its theme is one of the
          documents <pb/>published in your administration. A more glowing sketch could never have
          been drawn of the state of the country at the close of an administration.</p>
        <p>I pray my best regards to <name type="person">Mrs Polk</name>. I am sure you will find
          happiness in your own home after all the troubles, perplexities &amp; anxieties of <name type="place">Washington</name>. Your administration will stand out in bold relief, as
          the most successful of the century. I am only sorry we could not have completed the repeal
          of the Navigation laws, in time for you to have ratified a convention abolishing them. I
          enclose a copy of the bill just introduced into the House of Commons<note place="foot" n="2">Enclosure not found. A bill to partly repeal the Navigation Acts was first
            discussed in the House of Commons on <date when="1849-02-14">February 14, 1849</date>,
            and first read two days later. House of Commons, “A Bill to Amend the Laws in force for
            the Encouragement of British Shipping and Navigation,” <hi rend="italics">Sessional

          occasion offers, you will encourage in the Senate a strong disposition to act reciprocally
          on the subject.</p>
        <p>When at home, you should digest and arrange your papers; put to paper your most important
          reminiscences; and either write memoirs of your times, or prepare ample materials for
          them. In this you will serve your own fame &amp; your country.</p>
        <p>I do not doubt the administration will be proscriptive. Yet I have adopted your
            advice,<note place="foot" n="3">
                        <name type="person">Polk</name> to <name type="person">Bancroft</name>, <date when="1849-01-05">January 5, 1849</date>; <name type="person">Polk</name> to <name type="person">Bancroft</name>, <date when="1849-01-22">January

          a call at this place. Arrangements will be made to give the citizens an opportunity of
          seeing you; and to this end, we have concluded to give an old-fashioned, Tennessee,
          democratic barbacue; thereby affording the hard-fisted democracy a chance. I am gratified,
          that Secretary Walker, will be with you, for in him likewise the democracy, feel much
          interest. We will make arrangements, to have a carriage prepared for you, and your family;
          and the extra-coach, can carry your baggage; servants, and the gentlemen who will be with
          you. At the distance of fifty two miles from <name type="place">Barnesville</name>, a
          friend of ours <name type="person">Gen. Lowe</name> resides; and although the day’s travel
          will be rather long, you must make his home, the tarrying place for the night. He will be
          prepared for you, and your company; and will expect you. From his house to Columbus, is
          eighteen miles. You and your family must stop at my house; where I need scarcely assure
          you; you will meet with friends. If you can remain several days with us, we will be
          pleased. I will probably meet you at Macon; and will certainly do so, if some professional
          business does not prevent. . . .</p>

        <p>I have received your two letters of the 22nd Instant. I am gratified to learn from you,
          that you heartily approve the measures and policy of my administration. My term now near

          responsibility. If my country shall be satisfied with the policy I have thought it my duty
          to pursue I shall be amply rewarded.</p>

        <salute>Mr President:</salute>
        <p>I had the honor of being introduced to you in December last by <name type="person">Gen.
            Caleb Cushing</name>. The nature of the mission which brought me hither precludes my
          return to my native island, so long as the present government endures. I have therefore
          adopted as my own, the country over which you have so gloriously presided for the last
          four years and in which I have received my education.</p>
        <p>I, no doubt, encroach upon your kindness, Sir, by asking you a recommendation for <name type="person">Gen. Taylor</name> or <name type="person">Mr. Clayton</name>, with the
          object of obtaining the secretaryship of the commission for the adjustment of <pb/>Mexican
          claims; for the discharge of which a thorough knowledge of the Spanish language is
          expressly required: but I trust that if a ray of that partiality which you have always
          evinced for the general interests of Cuba falls to the lot of one of her sons, you will
          excuse the liberty of this step. I also feel confident that the circumstance of my being a
          stranger to party distinctions will enable you to recommend me without that <hi rend="italics">contrainte</hi> you might otherwise experience.</p>
        <p>Enclosed are two letters which I merely adjoin for the purpose of making myself better
          known to you.<note place="foot" n="2">Letters not found.</note> I beg of you, Sir, to
          return them after their perusal, under cover to me, to the keeper of the Irving House,
          with such an answer as I may be honoured with.</p>
        <p>I must apologize, Mr. President, for this intrusion on your precious time and earnestly
          request your kind indulgence.</p>

        <salute>Dear sir,</salute>
        <p>It affords me great pleasure to inform you &amp; your excellent Lady of the honor
          confered on you by the Sunday School Children of this city. <pb/>For two or three weeks
          past I have been holding a series of meetings for their special benefit, &amp; to awaken
          an interest, in their young minds, in behalf of the thousands of children in our country,
          who are destitute of all means of instruction, both literary &amp; religious. I am happy
          to say, my labors have not been altogether in vain—nearly $150.00 having been <hi rend="italics">voluntarily</hi> contributed by my young friends for the establishment of
          Sunday-schools in the West &amp; south West.</p>
        <p>At a large &amp; crowded meeting held yesterday afternoon, at the S[unday].S[chool].<note place="foot" n="1">Letters inserted to complete meaning.</note> Depository in Chalmer’s
          st., it was proposed to the little folks as a mark of their respect, to appropriate Sixty
          Dollars of their contributions towards constituting yourself &amp; <name type="person">Mrs. Polk</name>, Life Members of the Am. Sunday School Union. This was <hi rend="italics">unanimously</hi> agreed to, and could you, Sir, have seen the array of
          little hands, the bright faces &amp; the sparkling eyes, when it was said “all in favor of
          this proposition hold up your hands”—you could not have been otherwise than amused &amp;
          delighted—you would not have considered it by any means the smallest of the honors
          confered on you by the citizens of Charleston.</p>
        <p>Permit me, sir, to add that this Institution numbers among its officers &amp; Life
          Members, many of the most distinguished &amp; best men of our country.</p>
        <p>In a letter dated <date when="1829-04-27">April 27, 1829</date>, addressed to the
          Committee of Publication, Judge Bushrod Washington of Va., uses the following expression,
          in closing: “That Heaven may prosper the benevolent work in <pb/>which the Sunday-school
          Union are engaged, so honorable to them, &amp; so beneficial to our country, &amp; to
          those particularly who are the objects of their solicitude, is the ardent prayer of their
          faithful friend &amp; admirer.”</p>
        <p>In a letter to the Cor. Sec., Chief Justice <name type="person">Marshall</name> says—“No
          man estimates more highly than I do the real worth of your Society, or the intrinsic value
          of the objects it pursues. I am much, very much gratified at the success which has thus
          far attended its philanthropic, meritorious &amp; well-directed labors. I hope &amp;
          believe that the future will not form a contrast with the past.”</p>
        <p>It will afford us great pleasure to increase our list, by the addition of your name &amp;

        <salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
        <p>You will of course feel some anxiety to know the movements here since your departure
          &amp; the fate that awaits our friends. The rush for office upon the new secretaries has
          been so overwhelming that they have scarcely had leisure to look into the applications.
          The old Genl. himself says that by some accident or mistake <hi rend="italics">you</hi>
          had taken off the <hi rend="italics">Executive Journal</hi> &amp; therefore he had been
          dilatory in presenting his nominations. He could not know what offices he had to fill on
          that acct. Some of the Senators amuse themselves at such remarks &amp; some of his friends
          would be rejoiced, if he could not exhibit himself to the public as often as he does. The
          impression seems to be gaining ground that he is less suited to the office than his
          friends expected or than the democrats represented. I saw <name type="person">Clayton</name> on yesterday &amp; he took pains to pay a very high compliment to your
          admn. and to you personally. Tho. he differed upon many <pb/>questions, yet it had been
          honestly &amp; fairly conducted &amp; with great ability. That he had known you long in
          private &amp; public life, he gave you great credit for integrity &amp; ability &amp; for
          honorable &amp; upright purposes in public &amp; private. I think your popularity is
          greater at this time than any former period of your life.</p>
        <p>I understand the Judge on Thursday with a good deal of form &amp; ceremony, called in the
          assistants &amp; their clerks, one at a time &amp; introduced them, then took him to the
          Third story, where the Auditor at my request had them assembled &amp; introduced him to
          each one. He got through rather awkwardly, as much so as I should have done under similar
          circumstances. The clerks had for two or three days been frightened at the idea of Ewing
          coming in &amp; they looked bright &amp; cheerful when I spoke favorably of him, as the
          best of the Whigs except Whittelsey. He, as well as <name type="person">Clayton</name>,
          spoke in the strongest terms agt. proscription &amp; invited me to a conference with a
          relation to the officers. He was determined to retain the good officers, Whig or democrat.
          Before however we had said much, he was so much pressed by <name type="person">Mr
          C</name>, that we had to break it off, &amp; he has not invited a renewall of it. They
          will however be compelled to yield to the importunity of their friends tho. perhaps with
          more discretion &amp; judgment than in <date when="1841">1841</date>. I have seen none of
          the others of the Secretaries. You will see that Loyal &amp; Bigger have been
          re-nominated. Doct. Shelby was to day nominated in the place of Cheatham, &amp; <name type="person">Allen A. Hall</name> appointed in the place of Graham, so I <pb/>suppose
          Genl Barrow will be overslaughed. Gentry is hanging on yet it is said for office as well
          as Barrow. The offer of the P O Dep was probably designed to give him character at home so
          as to run him for Governor. Rumor has been busy about my 1 &amp; 3' assistants &amp; the
          6th Auditor.</p>
        <p>Rumor says that <name type="person">Jno C Clark</name> is to succeed Hobbie &amp; <name type="person">Jno S Skinner</name> in the place of <name type="person">Marron</name>.
            <name type="person">Clayton</name> of Ga son of the Judge succeeds <name type="person">McCalla</name>. The successors of <name type="person">Medill</name>, <name type="person">Young</name>, <name type="person">Burke</name>, <name type="person">Laughlin</name>, <name type="person">Gillet</name> have not yet been designated. <name type="person">Warren</name>, the leader of the Mormons in the last Iowa elections
          succeeds <name type="person">W. J. Brown</name>. They have done so little yet, that their
          friends are leaving in bad temper. Evans is in bad temper &amp; declined giving
          recomendations because <hi rend="italics">he had no influence</hi>, &amp; that the Cabinet
          had not been organized as the Whigs had a right to expect &amp; he will be horibly gauled
          by the doceur of Commissioner to settle Mexican Claims. The friends of <name type="person">Webster</name>, <name type="person">Clay</name> &amp; <name type="person">Taylor</name>
          will be seperated and as hostile as the barn burners &amp; old hunkers.</p>
        <p>Judge <name type="person">Clayton</name> takes the house &amp; furniture of <name type="person">Mr. B</name> except his carriage &amp; horses which were offered him at
          $500. The Judge offered me $400 this morning for my horses and at dinner again sent down
          &amp; offered $450. I declined tho. I believe I will sell if he offers $500. Knox has not
          recd an offer of more than $175 for yours. He thinks he cannot get more than $200. If I
          sell he had better take it than pay the expenses of sending them out. Our carriages were
          to have been shipped to day from Baltimore. I had them boxed here &amp; paid $30. each to
          Haslip.</p>
        <p>
                    <pb/>I intended to have been off on the evening of the 15th but my wife was not well

        <p>A great effort has been made to supersede <name type="person">Mr. R</name>, &amp; put in
          new men who would be agreeable to the Northern &amp; Southern democracy. Burke &amp; young
          Tucker of Va (son of the Judge) have been much talked but I think it has all failed &amp;
          I fear an opposition press will be established. There is no hope of compromise, unless it

          be acceptable to the Calhoun men tho. regarded as a decided friend of Woodbury &amp; taken

          They too feel it &amp; speak in strong terms of it. Should I remain any time I will write

          return immediately to Washington, perhaps on a boat leaving Columbus yesterday for

        <salute>Dear Sir.</salute>
        <p>I suppose by the time this reaches Nashville you will have reached home. I hope you may
          not be knocked up by the hospitality &amp; attention of the ardent Southerners as <name type="person">Mr Walker</name> seems to have been.</p>
        <p>After due consultation with <name type="person">Col Johnson</name>, &amp; after enquiring
          of many persons here we concluded to have both your carriage and his boxed up here &amp;
          sent over to Baltimore in the cars which we have done. We had them taken off the running
          gear and well boxed and the wheels, running gear &amp;c carefully wrapped with two pair of
          harness &amp; saddle put inside the carriage. I wrote to Marriott to have them insured,
          yours at $1000. Henderson wrote me that his vessel would leave about to day. The three
          boxes left by Bowman I had sent off as soon as the freight <pb/>trains commenced running.
          I have not heard from Knox &amp; Black of their arrival at Wheeling. I requested them to
          attend to them &amp; advise me of their safe arrival &amp;c.</p>
        <p>I have been a good deal concerned to know what was best to do with your horses. <name type="person">Col Johnson</name> has been trying to sell his and is trying now. He fixed
          upon to day to start them off if he did not get $600 for them. I went down to see him
          every day &amp; found him falling in price &amp; finally yesterday he got down to $450
          &amp; thought “we had better let them stay another week.” In the mean time yours were
          eating their heads off at a dollar a day &amp; a fraction over. I ascertained it would
          cost you at least $90 to take your horses through the country by themselves. <name type="person">Mr Pumphrey</name> told me moreover that he thought it most probable one
          of them would break down in going out, as he had unquestionably given away in the back
          &amp; loins. In this condition of things after the last interview I had with <name type="person">Col Johnson</name>, I went &amp; closed the sale of them to a man who had
          previously offered me $175, for $190 cash. I then paid up the bill at Pumphrey for the
          horses $15. &amp; which leaves $175.</p>
        <p>I hope this will meet your approbation for though really it is very low, yet under all
          circumstances I thought it your interest for me to sell. <name type="person">Mr
            Buchanan</name> has sold his for a little over a hundred, and <name type="person">Gov.
            Marcy</name> is offering his at almost any price without a purchaser.</p>
        <p>I have written to <name type="person">Gen Marriott</name> after he has shipped &amp;
          insured the carriage to send me the amount of bills paid by him. <name type="person">Col
            Johnson</name>
          <pb/>contracted with the Coachmaker for boxing the carriages at $30 apiece which I thought
          high, but paid. When I hear from Marriott &amp; pay his bill I will send you a statement
          enclosing you a draft for the ballance in my hands.</p>
        <p>There is small bill of $5. presented to me for liquers &amp; cordials bought by Bowman of
          Peters, which I suppose I will pay. I requested him to wait until Bowman returned &amp; if
          not explained I would pay it. The Intelligencer &amp; Union I have had sent to <name type="place">Nashville</name>, all yr newspapers refused, and directed Col Gardner if
          any letters came addressed to you in yr individual name to forward them to <name type="place">Nashville</name>.</p>
        <p>I believe this is all the business you left me to attend to for you. If at any time you
          wish any thing attended to, I will be more than pleased to do so for you.</p>
        <p>Augusta &amp; the children are all very well &amp; Augusta desires me to present her
          specially to you &amp; aunt <name type="person">Sally</name>.</p>

        <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
        <p>My Wife, yesterday, got up &amp; we were enabled to get without an inconvenience to <name type="person">Mrs. Brawner</name>. She was at breakfast this morning &amp; been up most
          of the day, so that we hope in a few days to be on our way home.</p>
        <p>The Senate is still in session many of them expecting to adjourn tomorrow and a few think
          not until the close of the week, as <name type="person">Col. Benton</name> is expected to
          day to give the late administration a kick, by way of <pb/>currying favor with the
          incoming admn. which has already appointed his son-in law Jones, the Secretary to the
          Mexican commissioners. It is said he will to day in secret session make an attack upon the
          protocol for publication. His effort is looked for with much anxiety but without the least
          apprehension of harm to any one save himself. The anxiety is felt, to learn how far he
          will go for the incomers &amp; whether he will be able to save the barn burners. Whitcomb
          said, he had heard of <hi rend="italics">explosions</hi> before and that he expected one
          would not be less injurious to him than some <hi rend="italics">others</hi>. The utter
          prostration of Van Buren, and of course his own hopes, has made him frantic. Rumor speaks
          of his emigration to California and it may be to carry out some such scheme as many
          attributed to him when Fremont was sent out, with his proclamation. His course of action
          in the Senate has wholy changed in a few years, his old associations abandoned, new ones
          formed with the most bitter &amp; malignant of his former assailants. I shall learn what I
          can of the proceedings of the day in time—<note place="foot" n="1">Johnson may have used
            this dash as either a comma or a period; others in this letter, whose meanings are
            clear, have been represented as such.</note>I hope to send you a sketch in this letter.
          Several whig senators board with me &amp; Imay perhaps get a hint in the time for the mail
          of to night.</p>
        <p>The Senate did a noble act on yesterday in the rejection of McGauhey of Indiana, who had
          been nominated as the Gov. of Minesotta. It was done expressly upon the ground of his
          opposition to the war, refusing supplies &amp; voting agt. pre-emptions &amp;c. Even
          Gentry said publicly to day that he did not <hi rend="italics">regret it much</hi>. He
          &amp; Barrow are still here. <pb/>I know but little of their prospects except from <hi rend="italics">their</hi> countenances. <name type="person">Genl Bradford</name> is
          chagrined at not getting the collectorship at <name type="place">San Francisco</name>
          &amp; feels it the more on account of the person selected in preference to him, the noted
          Colyer of Ohio who wished in the <name type="place">Philadelphia</name> convention, the
          nomination of old whitey for Vice President. Bradford spoke of you &amp; your admn. in
          terms not less strong than did <name type="person">John M. Clayton</name> without any
          qualification of his differing with you on some political questions. The noted Penrose you
          see, is the Assistant Sec. of the Treasury which made it necessary for <name type="person">McClintock Young</name> to resign, or be degraded into a subordinate clerkship.
          Hannegan will be, probably has been commissioned. The old Genl. I understand says in
          strong terms that he will not recall Donelson. They did not drop Bigger &amp; Loyal
          because the Virginia elections were too near &amp; they will be very cautious &amp;
          liberal in the States where the elections come on this summer. I was somewhat surprized at
          the appointment of Shelby over cheatham. Isuppose <name type="person">Mr. B.</name> felt
          himself strong enough in the State, but when the people compare <name type="person">Graham</name> &amp; <name type="person">cheatham</name> with their succ[ess]ors<note place="foot" n="2">Letters inserted to complete probable meaning.</note> they will not
          be apt to conclude that the country has gained any thing by such changes. I know not a
          change which is not prejudicial to the best interests of the country when regarded as mere
          business men. The appointment of Penrose is a disgrace to the State from which he is
          taken. What a falling off from old Dodge to McGahey! Many suppose that Meredith will lead
          Ewing &amp; Collamer agt the balance of the cabinet with views beyond the present
          <pb/>administration and if so an explosion may be expected before the dog days are over.
          The former are regarded as thorough Whigs cut throats “died in the wool”; whilst the
          latter are understood not to favor proscription to any great extent, to abandon old issues
          under the hope of making new ones, that may be regarded with more favor among the people.
          I have much faith in the integrity &amp; liberality of Collamer but not the least in the
          other two. They are thorough Clay men I presume, whilst the balance side with Clayton
          &amp; Crittenden.</p>
        <p>My sale is going on to day. Knox sold your horses for $175 &amp; paid me the $30 for
          boxing your carriage. I could not but regret seeing them in the avenue yesterday in a
          Hack. He could not have done better as your driver had destroyed the character of the
          smaller horse and I shall probably sell mine. <name type="person">Clayton</name> offered
          me $450. <name type="person">Mr. Buchanan</name> sold his for $150 &amp; his carriage for
          $350. Reverdy <name type="person">Johnson</name>’s son in law (Dangerfield) has rented
          Gadsbys house &amp; Madam called to see my horses on yesterday. The other Secretaries are
          not located. <name type="person">Judge Mason</name> has been at his farm and expected to
          return to day.</p>

                    <pb/>Having painted the battle of Resacca de la Palma one of the most brillant victories
          achieved in the last war brought to such a glorious end under your administration, I
          should be highly gratified if you would do me the honor to pay to my picture now exhibited
          at the St Louis ball Room a visit at any time you may find convenient. I would consider
          your visit as the best reward for my labor.</p>

        <salute>Sir</salute>
        <p>I received a few days since by the hand of the <name type="person">Hon. Lynn Boyd</name>
          the splendid Sword awarded to me by the Congress of the United States, and made under your
          directions, accompanied by your kind letter of the 2nd instant.<note place="foot" n="2">Letter not found.</note>
                </p>
        <p>For this high evidence of my Country’s approbation I am most grateful. I accept it as an
          honor confered equally upon myself and the Officers, and soldiers composing my Gallant
          Volunteer-Division at Monterey.</p>
        <p>One of the great inducements I had in entering the Army was to sustain, and if possible
          give additional efficiency and importance to that <pb/>branch of service on which every
          free Country must mainly depend for the perpetuation of her liberty.</p>
        <p>The battle of Monterey however important in its results, derives additional consequence
          from the fact that it was the first in the Mexican War where a Volunteer force was
          engaged—that they won on that day, not only a reputation in the eyes of the world, but a
          confidence in themselves which was nobly sustained and emulated throughout the War.</p>
        <p>I trust that it will not be infered for a moment from what I have said of Volunteers,
          that it is my intention to detract in the slightest degree from the merits of the Regular
          Army. On the contrary I look upon ours as the very best in the world, and deem it of the
          most vital importance to our success in Arms.</p>
        <p>Permit me Sir in conclusion to congratulate you on the successful termination of your
          most arduous and highly important administration, and to assure you that you will carry
          with you into private life my warmest wishes for your happiness and prosperity.</p>

        <salute>Dearer Sir,</salute>
        <p>To day is a bright beautiful [day]<note place="foot" n="2">Johnson struck out the
            bracketed text.</note> &amp; my wife so much improved that we shall go to relay house
          this evening &amp; start for Tenn. in the morning.</p>
        <p>The death of <name type="person">Dickenson</name> of <name type="place">Ohio</name> has
          delayed the action of the Senate for two days and to day <name type="person">Col.
            B.</name> is expected to make his expose and rumor says it will occupy the Senate two
          days, that <name type="person">Genl Cass</name> is ready to reply &amp; that <name type="person">Genl. Foote</name> will assail him &amp; his <hi rend="italics">whole
            life</hi> in the bitterest terms. His speech it is understood will be not only an
          assault upon the protocol but a review of the <hi rend="italics">whole</hi>
          administration. Some of the Senators on both sides entertain the hope, that the debate may
          be postponed for the want of a quorum. It is understood that he will have no democratic
          Senator to vote with him. The position of the whigs is such as to render it probable that
          none of them will go with him. It seems to me that the effect of his speech must be if it
          can have any to incite Mexico to make new demands upon our Country, or to induce them to
          declare the treaty void &amp; set up a claim to <name type="place">California</name> &amp;
            <name type="place">New Mexico</name>. Of course this will be bringing trouble upon the
          administration. They can not, dare-not take grounds with him for <name type="place">Mexico</name> &amp; will not therefore probably vote with him. <name type="person">Dicks</name> &amp; <name type="person">Niles</name> being now out I hope he will have
          no one to stand with him. It is generally regarded as a movement into the ranks of the
          <pb/>opposition &amp; it is doubtful whether the whigs are more alarmed or the democrats
          more rejoiced at it. After his speech is made in secret Session &amp; published as in the
          case of Kearny, it is said he moves off to Missouri &amp; there will vindicate his course
          during the next summer. If he fails in justifying himself as he must do, then it is
          thought he will join his son in law in California for what purpose no one can easily tell,
          probably not to become a gold digger. The democratic party has nothing further to expect
          from him.</p>
        <p>The appointments get worse &amp; worse. Gov Penington, of “broad seal” notoriety has been
          nominated as the Gov. of Minesotta, <hi rend="italics">Goodrich of Dover</hi> as the chief
          Justice. These taken with the appointments of <name type="person">Penrose</name> &amp;
            <name type="person">Warren</name> leave but little hope that even Common honesty will be
          looked to in his appointments. Instead of honesty, &amp; fidelity to the constitution, the
          leading politicians are to be secured by filling the offices with their kith &amp; kin,
          Websters son &amp; brother in law, Ewings son, Bentons son in law, Colliers brother from
          Ohio etc, etc, and rumor says to day that <name type="place">James Watson Web</name> goes
          to Spain. Brownlow is here seeking patronage for his paper which goes to <name type="person">Knoxville</name> soon &amp; <name type="person">Mr. Bell</name> sent for
          me and conversed freely about the patronage of the Post office particularly with a view to
          the printing &amp; with the view of satisfying Brownlow, talked freely &amp; liberally as
          to the office holders and agt. removals &amp; professing great confidence in my judgment
          &amp; integrity.</p>
        <p>I have</p>
        <p>
                    <pb/>Several gentlemen calling in delayed the completion of my letter &amp; I now write
          from the Relay House.</p>
        <p>The great speech has been made &amp; finished in a day &amp; answered. <name type="person">Mr. T.</name> informs me there was nothing new in it &amp; nothing
          calculated to affect the Admn. Foote replied, in a most bitter sarcastic manner &amp;
          there all has been stopped. Underwood is with me &amp; the Senate will adjourn
          tomorrow.</p>
        <p>We have had a story in circulation intended no doubt to injure the Admn., that <abbr>J.
            K. W.</abbr> had been connected with Corchoran in his stock speculations and had made
          $100.000 &amp; hence an inference is attempted to be drawn from it, that he was the medium
          for securing the Admn. influence to <name type="person">Mr. C.</name> &amp;c. I did not
          hear it until late yesterday &amp; have since had no opportunity of seeing either him or
            <name type="person">Mr. C</name>. I learn however the letter contradicts the whole story
          with warmth, &amp; I presume <abbr>J. K. W.</abbr>’s actual condition will confirm it. The
          whigs will leave no stone unturned to fix upon us some stain upon the late Admn. but it
          should become too popular when Compared with their own.</p>

          your departure; but I fear, that you would not be as much pained, to learn the expressions

        <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
        <p>At recent respective meetings of the Amasagassian and Philomathian Societies of
          Cumberland University, you were unanimously elected to deliver an address before them, the
          last week of next July, which will be the Commencement of our University.</p>
        <p>Nothing would be more delightful to us, or our citizens here; nothing would give us
          greater character, than that you, should in this particular acceed to the unanimous, nay,
          earnest desire of the community here, of citizens and students.</p>
        <p>What could be more patriotic? what more praiseworthy, than for you, having just retired
          from a brilliant administration justly commanding the love and esteem of your countrymen,
          and the admiration of the world, now to lend your aid to the cause of learning, <pb/>which
          is the cause of our Country?</p>
        <p>Our earnest desire that you should come at the time and for the purpose specified, might
          cause us to urge the matter beyond that which would be proper. We can only hope that you
          will come. Should you answer favorably we will write again and be more explicit as to the
          time and circumstances.</p>

        <p>Your Letter of 20th Feby was duly received requesting the funds in my hands approprated
          in a certain way. I have not been abble to make the arrangement you desired
          advantageously, therefore have done nothing in the matter.</p>
        <p>I have money in the Branch of the Union Bank of Tennessee at <name type="place">Memphis</name> and if you desire it can send you my check for the amnt due <pb/>you,
          which the parent Bank at Nashville will cash for you.</p>
        <p>We had a killing frost night before last destroying all the fruit &amp; materially
          injuring the wheat crop. The Cotten was not sufficiently up to be injured. I fear it may
          have been up a little further south &amp; may have suffered.</p>

          that, prompts me to say, that a favour of this kind could not be more worthily bestowed.
          It will at least do an old friend, the greatest posable kindness.</p>

                    <pb/>Dear Sir</salute>
        <p>The Order of Odd Fellows at this place, and many of the friends of education are engaged
          in building an institution of learning at our village for the education of females. The
          design is to erect large and commodious buildings and to furnish them with suitable
          libraries and apparatus so as to ensure a thorough knowledge of the branches that are
          taught. The funds that we have raised by subscriptions (which for our part of the country
          are liberal) are not sufficient for our purpose.</p>
        <p>We as a committee appointed by our Lodge for the purpose of corresponding and procuring
          subscriptions, address you on the subject, and from your character and known solicitude
          for the cause of education, we confidently rely on receiving aid from you.</p>

        <salute>Dear uncle,</salute>
        <p>I received your letter<note place="foot" n="2">Letter not found.</note> day before
          yesterday &amp; I am very glad that you have entirely recovered from your sickness. I was
          afraid you would get sick when you left <name type="place">Washington</name>, for I knew
          you would be surounded by a crowd of friend (political ones) from the time you left, until
          you reached <name type="place">Nashville</name>. I saw more flattering accounts of your
          receptions than I did of <name type="person">Gen Taylor</name>’s &amp; I think it is a
          sure sign that you were as popular when you vacated the Presidential chair as you were
          when you assumed it. I hope that aunt <name type="person">Sallie</name> was not
          inconvenienced by the journey, but I know she would not allow herself to be troubled. I
          received a letter from aunt <name type="person">Marry Wilson</name> yesterday. She says
          all my brother’s &amp; sisters were well when she heard from them. She was out to see old
            <name type="person">Mrs. Smart</name> who lives near <name type="place">Charlotte</name>. The old lady is 87 years of age, knew you when you were a little boy
          &amp; still insists upon calling you little <name type="person">Jimmy Polk</name>. Please
          tell me where cousin <name type="person">Jenny Hays</name> is when you write again. I
          never wished to be any where so much as I wish to be in <name type="place">Tennessee</name>. I want to see Grandma aunt <name type="person">Sallie</name> &amp;
          yourself. I am not tired of West Point, I like it more than ever, but I want to get away
          for a short time. We have commenced general review &amp; the examination will commence in
          a month. After it is over we will go into camp. Then is the hardest time of all, it threw
          me up last time &amp; I expect the next will be worse. <name type="person">Marshall
            Walker</name>
          <pb/>sends his love to you &amp; aunt <name type="person">Sallie</name>. I am well &amp;
          do not fear the examination. About demerit I will say nothing, as I have already forfeited
          your good opinion on account of the number I have now. I may have been careless about them
          uncle, but I assure I hate them as bad as you do. Remember me to all Aunt <name type="person">Sallie</name> especially.</p>

        <p>Dr Sir:</p>
        <p>I have received your kind letter of the 18th ultimo, together with the accompanying
          numbers of the “Literary American,” which you forwarded to my address. I had not before
          seen the letters of your correspondent from the South, nor had I any knowledge that such
          letters were written. I will preserve them, as containing a historical notice of some of
          the incidents of my return journey from the seat of Government to my residence in
          Tennessee. I beg you to accept my sincere thanks for them, and also for the friendly
          interest you have been pleased to express <pb/>in my personal welfare.</p>
        <p>Desiring to become a subscriber to your valuable paper, I request that you will cause it
          to be sent to me at this place. I observe from a publicatio[n]<note place="foot" n="1">Letter cut off side of page.</note> notice in the paper, that you have an agent in this
          City. As soon as I can see him, I will pay the subscription for one year.</p>

          Rough &amp; Ready has all vanished amid the bitter &amp; indiscriminate scramble for
          office, and the hero of Buena Vista has subsided into the inefficiency &amp; ignorant head
          of a great government. His <hi rend="italics">individuality</hi> is no where felt in the
          administration, &amp; hence with the incongruous &amp; uncertain materials composing his
          Cabinet, it is every day matter of doubt what cause will be pursued or what political
          interest &amp; faction has control. The Cabinet (with little ability at best) are

        <p>In the meantime, Connecticut on the North &amp; Virginia in the South are going in an
          avalanche against them, and they are at a loss to know whether it is that they <hi rend="italics">proscribe</hi> too much or dont proscribe enough, &amp; hence halt &amp;
          hesitate again. It is felt here &amp; among our friends North that the hand-writing is on
          the wall, &amp; that the administration is already doomed—doomed because of its own
          inefficiency &amp; because of the standard they have to work up to, for every where now
          your most bitter opponents even, admit that <hi rend="italics">circumstances</hi> made

        <p>
                    <pb/>As might be expected the <hi rend="italics">quid nunc’s</hi> are already casting

          for another &amp; stronger man and you may remember if you choose the prediction I now
          make, that the Democratic party three years hence, will be divided in sentiment between
          bringing you from your retirement to lead the party, and taking up that member of your
          administration who has impressed himself most, on the startling events of your time, <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Walker</name>
                    </hi>. He does not <hi rend="italics">mean</hi> to live in the District the entire three years, but evidently has it in view
          quietly to settle down in Pittsburg or may be even in New York, and thinks Washington a
          most convenient mode of changing his domiciliation, without attracting public attention to
          his ulterior purpose.</p>
        <p>I throw these out for your reflection. I wish no reply.</p>
        <p>My own business prospects are very encouraging, &amp; I shall have a full good

        <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
        <p>I hasten to forward you the proof of the <hi rend="italics">utter falsity</hi> and <hi rend="italics">maliciousness</hi> of certain charges lately circulated against my
          character in the <name type="place">United States</name>. There is nothing even resembling
          truth in these base accusations.</p>
        <p>The author of these charges, I am sorry to say is <name type="person">Mr <hi rend="italics">Silas E Barrows</hi>
                    </name>, well known for his eccentricities. He
          asserts that he received his information from an “official” source connected with the
          American Government in this city. The source referred to however <hi rend="italics">attempts</hi> to deny that he has given any full statements as warrant these base
          charges.</p>
        <p>One of the malignant methods resorted to by <name type="person">Mr. Barrows</name> for
          the aspersion of my character was the circulation of an Article from the low and
          scurrilous “<hi rend="italics">Sondag Hadet</hi>” or Sunday Journal printed in this city,
          a print notorious for its weekly attacks, on the King, the Royal Family, and all persons
          of character or repectability.</p>
        <p>The most conclusive proof has been forwarded to <name type="person">Mr Clayton</name> and
            <name type="person">Gen Taylor</name>, and it now remains to be seen what an
          administration which has hastened on no proof, to disgrace a public servant, will do when
          its <pb/>action is proved to have been erroneous.</p>
        <p>Armed as I am with proof, at all points, to shew this base conspiracy, I fear not the
          result. It will result in my great political advantage.</p>
        <p>It may be proper to add that the hostility of the consul here, who furnished <name type="person">Mr Barrows</name> with the rumors alluded to, was aroused by the fact that
          I peremptorily refused to get in free of duty certain articles he had the impudence to
          send to my adress during his late visit to the <name type="place">United States</name>!!! </p>
        <p>I have felt it my duty to communicate the matter at once for your perusal. It will shew
          that a public officer, who had the honor of serving under your Administration, has been
          hastily and basely traduced, without the slighest reason.</p>
        <p>With constant wishes for your continued happiness, and that of your family, . . . .</p>

          columns of the <name type="place">Pennsylvanian</name>. I thank you for them, and beg
          through you to make my acknowledgements, to the beautiful lady, by whom you inform me, one
          of them was copied from your files. As you inform me, she is one of my best frieds, I will
          be careful, to preserve the copy.</p>
        <p>Now, that I am a private citizen, relieved from all public responsibilities, I am quietly
          at home enjoying the repose which I so much needed. I was seriously indisposed during the
          latter part of my return journey from Washington, but my health is now entirely
          restored.</p>
        <p>I desire that you will consider me a subscriber to the <name type="place">Pennsylvanian</name>, and have the paper forwarded to me.</p>

        <salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>I received early in the last month your esteemed letter of the 25th <pb/>of March, with
          the one enclosed.<note place="foot" n="1">
                        <name type="person">Marcy</name> to <name type="person">Polk</name>, <date when="1848-11-20">November 20, 1848</date>.</note>
          The letter is what I had no doubt it would be, and is entirely satisfactory. The time at
          which the publication I had contemplated may be made, will depend on circumstances, and
          the seeming propriety or necessity of making it. The subject seems, to have passed out of
          the public mind, and indeed at no time to have produced much impression. It may however be
          hereafter revived, in the public press, and in that event, I am fully prepared not only to
          vindicate my own course, but to expose the authors of the charge, and the unworthy motives
          which induced them to make it.</p>
        <p>I have been much engaged since my return home, in seeing my friends, in becoming settled
          at our new residence in this City, and in attending to my private affairs, which had been
          long neglected. I am now quietly at home, enjoying the rest which I so much needed. My
          return journey homeward, was marked by a succession of public receptions, and was
          exceedingly fatiguing, and during the latter part of it, my health suffered severely, but
          is now entirely restored. The manifestations of the public respect, to which you allude in
          your letter,<note place="foot" n="2">In this and the next paragraph, <name type="person">Polk</name> discusses <name type="person">Marcy</name> to <name type="person">Polk</name>, <date when="1849-05-25">March 25, 1849</date>.</note> with which I was
          every-where, received, without distinction of political party, were as unexpected, as they
          could not fail to be gratifying. It is the highest and most cherished reward, which a
          retiring public servant could receive. I hope you may be right in the opinion you express,
          now that we are out of power, that there is “a disposition every-where to do us better
          justice than heretofore.” We had four years of unceasing labour, care and <pb/>anxiety,
          and of high public responsibility. You My Dear Sir: had your full part in the
          administration, and dispassionate men of all parties, must award to you, the high merit of
          having most faithfully, and with distinguished ability, conducted the Department over
          which you presided. Our acts are now a part of the public history, and I am content, that
          an impartial public judgment shall pass upon them.</p>
        <p>I think you are right in the opinion you express, that the new administration, will be
          highly proscriptive, and whether they avow it or not, that they will act upon the
          doctrine, that “to the victors belong the spoils.[”]<note place="foot" n="3">Closing
            quotation mark missing.</note> I never doubted that it would be so, and from the moment
          of <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Genl. Taylor</name>’s</hi> election, often so
          expressed myself, and I think to yourself among others. Indeed I never knew a professed
          no-party, party before an election, or a party professing great liberality and moderation
          towards their political opponents, who did not, if they obtained power, become
          proscriptive, if not vindictive. As far as developements have yet been made, the new
          administration would seem to be devoting a very large portion of their time and attention
          to the disposition of the public patronage, among the hords, of hungry political partisans
          who seek place. Until the meeting of Congress, it is not probable that their measures of
          policy will be developed in a tangible and distinct form. It is not difficult however to
          foresee, that they will, upon some subjects, widely depart from the Republican policy, and
          that to that extent, the administration must be unsuccessful, if not disastrous, to those
          who <pb/>conduct it, and to the party in power. But I will not indulge in further
          speculations. When a few months more shall have elapsed, as Mr Ritchie would say, <hi rend="italics">nous verrons</hi>.</p>
        <p>I believe I once suggested to you the great importance, of having presented to the
          country, a truthful and reliable history of the remarkable events, which were croweded
          into my Presidential term, and especially of the war, and intimated to you, a desire that
          you should undertake the work.<note place="foot" n="4">Letter, if any, not found.</note>
          <hi rend="italics">Bancroft</hi> could do it well, and I had thought of writing to him,
          and calling his attention to the subject. Your knowledge of facts, and the considerations,
          upon which we acted, especially after <name type="person">Mr. B.</name> retired from the
          Cabinet, and more particularly as relates to the war, would be more extensive and minute
          than his could be. Have you given any thought to the suggestion I made to you on the
          subject?</p>

        <salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>I regretted exceedingly your resolve to return to Washington from Columbus Georgia, and
          still more that the State of your health, rendered it, in your judgement necessary that
          you should do so. When I left you at <hi rend="italics">Macon</hi> I had the impression
          that your indisposition was not serious, and confidently calculated, as was your purpose,
          that you join me again at Columbus. The weather was unfavourable, or I still think you
          would have done so. Learning at Columbus, that preperations had been made at <hi rend="italics">Montgomery</hi> to receive us, at a particular day, on which we were
          expected to arrive at that place,<note place="foot" n="1">Letter, if any, not
            found.</note> I reluctantly proceeeded on my journey, leaving you still behind, but
          hoping that you would overtake me at <hi rend="italics">Montgomery</hi>. In this I was
          disappointed. At <hi rend="italics">Opelika</hi> I met on the day I left Columbus, a
          committee from Montgomery, with a special train of cars, in waiting to receive us. They
          expressed great regret that you were not with me. After spending a day and night at
          Montgomery, I proceeded to Mobile, and it was not until <hi rend="italics">Mr Duncan</hi>
          overtook me at <hi rend="italics">New Orleans</hi>, that I learned that you had resolved
          to proceeed no further on the journey. This I regretted, though you avoided great danger,
          from exposure to the <hi rend="italics">cholera</hi> which was prevailing with great
          mortality at <name type="place">New-Orleans</name>. There were a few <pb/>cases at <hi rend="italics">Mobile</hi>, and I was advised by medical gentlemen not to tarry in New
          Orleans. On reaching the latter City, I was unwell, and desired to pass immediately
          through it. I was met however at the Lake-shore, by some of the public authorities of the
          City, and was assured by the <hi rend="italics">Mayor</hi> and others, that there was not
          the slightest danger of cholera. They informed me that extensive preperations had been
          made to give you and myself a public reception, a public dinner &amp;c, and I found that I
          would be compelled to yield to their wishes or seem to act rudely. Your frieds in <name type="place">New Orleans</name> expressed great regret at your absence. I remained two
          days and one night in <name type="place">New Orleans</name>, and proceeded up the River,
          but was far from being well. Though I had been assured that there was no danger from
          cholera, I learned afterwards, that during the week I was in <name type="place">New
            Orleans</name>, there were 266. deathes from cholera in the Hospitals alone. This did
          not include those who had frieds in condition to nurse them, without sending them to the
          hospital. Many of these doubtless fell victims to the disease. I met <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Genl. Hugh Dunlap</name>
                    </hi> whom you knew, apparently in fine
          health. He was attacked of cholera &amp; died in less than a week afterwards. I continued
          so unwell on the Boat, that I was unable to go on shore, or to receive the civilities
          tendered, above <hi rend="italics">Baton Rouge</hi>. At Natchez &amp; Vicksburg I was
          compelled to decline. At <hi rend="italics">Memphis</hi> being the first point I touched
          in my own State, I was forced much against my will to go on shore for a short time &amp;
          suffered severely in consequence of it. Several persons died of cholera on Board the Boat,
          and our servant girl <pb/>had an attack of it, but my disease was fortunately of a bilious
          type. I became so ill, that under medical advice I stopped at Smithland four days, and
          arrived at this place very feeble. Rest has restored me, and I am now in my usual health.
          We are quietly settled in our new residence, and I am enjoying the repose which I so much
          needed. Nothing would have given me more pleasure, than to have had you accompany me
          through the tour to <name type="place">Mississippi</name>, and after spending a short time
          with your frieds there, to have paid me a visit at this place. The Democracy here would
          have given you a cordial and warm reception. I hope you may have it in your power to pay
          me a visit next autumn. You ought to visit your old constituents in <name type="place">Mississippi</name> &amp; this will be directly in your way. I expect to visit my
          plantation in <hi rend="italics">Yalobusha</hi> about the middle of October. If you could
          be here at that time, I would be delighted to have your company down. At that time too,
          you would find our Legislature and Supreme Court in Session, and would meet many of your
          acquaintances and frieds.</p>
        <p>I have written so long a letter, that I must postpone saying many things, I would be
          pleased to say, on public affairs, and more espcially in relation to the progress, which
          our successors in the administration seem to be making, and the embarrassments which they
          are manifestly encountering. Any thing I could say however, would be from a view of things
          at a distance, and would be mere speculation possibly with out much value. As you are
          located at the seat of Government, I should <pb/>rather ask information from you, than
          attempt to impart any to you. Will you at your leisure give me any information you may
          have, as well as your views of the State of things as they exist.</p>

            Motivated by the “crisis” of <name type="person">Polk</name>’s being “In danger of being

            “reaffirm” resolutions they passed <date when="1848-11-08">November 8, 1848</date>,
            approving his administration. They declare it “the first in the Annals of America” and

            pledges which he made when he accepted the nomination of the Office of President.” They

        <salute>Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>I transmit to you herewith a letter with its enclosures, which relates exclusively to
          your own affairs.<note place="foot" n="1">
                        <name type="person">Polk</name> enclosed <name type="person">John M. Clayton</name> to <name type="person">William H. Polk</name>,
              <date when="1849-05-08">May 8, 1849</date>, in which was enclosed, in turn, a copy of
            a letter from Angelo Conci, dated <date when="1849-03-01">March 13, 1849</date>, stating
            the amount due him from <name type="person">William</name>. The enclosed versions have
            not been found, but, for <name type="person">Clayton</name>’s letter, see
            <abbr>L</abbr>, copy. <abbr>DNA–RG</abbr> 59.</note> The letter to you was sent under
          cover to me,<note place="foot" n="2">
                        <name type="person">Clayton</name> to <name type="person">James K. Polk</name>, <date when="1849-05-08">May 8, 1849</date>.</note>
          because as you will perceive, the Secetary of State (<hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Clayton</name>
                    </hi>) was not informed of your place of residence. I
          have heard you speak of your indebtedness for house rent at <name type="place">Naples</name>, and had the impression that you had made arrangements for its payment.
          You certainly ought to have done so, for you could not neglect this, without seriously
          suffering in your reputation as a public man. It is due to your own honour, that you
          should give prompt attention to the matter, now that the formal interposition of your
          Government has been involved, and it has in a formal manner been brought to your notice.
          If you do not, you may expect soon to see it the subject of public discussion not only in
          the newspapers, but in Congress next winter. The party politically opposed to <pb/>me, and
          now in power would delight in the opportunity to assail you, and through you the
          administration by whom you were appointed. You should without delay answer <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Clayton</name>’</hi>s letter, and state the
          reasons, why the debt has not been paid, if you have any which are satisfactory. Whether
          you have any satisfactory reasons for neglecting it, or not, you should inform him, that
          you have made arrangements for its immediate payment. You should without a moment’s delay,
          make provision for its payment, and write to your brother-in-law <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Corse</name>
                    </hi> in <name type="place">New York</name>, to make the
          remittance to <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr Rowan</name>
                    </hi> with
          instructions to make the payment. I beseech you to do this. If you do not, it will turn
          out to be a more serious injury to your reputation than you are aware of.</p>
        <p>I wish you to return to me, the letter from <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Samuel
              P. Walker</name>
                    </hi>, which I enclosed to you a few days ago.<note place="foot" n="3">

          which relates to your own business. I have as yet found no saddle-horse which suits me. I
          am strongly inclined to believe that yours will. If you have not sold him, and shall meet
          with an opportunity, send him in to me that I may try him. If I do not keep him I will pay
          all expenses of sending him here and returning him; though I think it almost certain I
          would keep him. If you send him, let me know the price. I have not purchased carriage
          horses as yet. There are none in this market that suit me.</p>

        <salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>I have not heard from you, since I took leave of you at <name type="place">Washington</name> on the evening of the 5th of March. I should have written to you
          earlier, <pb/>but on my arrival at home I was in feeble health, and have been since, much
          occupied in becoming settled at my new residence in this City, seeing my old friends, and
          in giving some attention to my private affairs, which had been long neglected. In a letter
          received from <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Gov. Marcy</name>
                    </hi> early in
          April, he mentions incidentally, that you had resolved to settle in <name type="place">Richmond</name> and resume the practice of your profession. In this I think you were
          right. <name type="place">Richmond</name> is a much more eligible residence <hi rend="italics">for you</hi>, than either <name type="place">South-hampton</name> or
            <name type="place">Washington</name>. A native of <name type="place">Virginia</name>,
          and identified with her people and her political principles from your youth up, you are
          now at the <name type="place">Capitol</name> of that noble <name type="place">Old
            Commonweath</name>, and should you desire again to engage in public life, you are
          located at the very place you should be. I calculate that your withdrawal from public
          life, will be but temporary, and that you cannot long remain a private citizen. Whatever
          your wishes may be in this respect, you have my hearty good wishes for your success.</p>
        <p>I congratulate you upon the glorious triumph achieved by the Democracy of <name type="place">Virginia</name> in the late election. No man in the Union can be more
          gratified at the result than I am. It is but the beginning of the counter revolution in
          the popular sentiment, which, must, end in the restoration of Democratic principles, &amp;
          measures, four years hence. Our successors in the Federal administration, have probably
          learned by this time, that it is one thing to be the <hi rend="italics">Outs</hi> with the
          privilege of fault-finding, and quite a different thing to be the <hi rend="italics">Ins</hi>, charged with the conduct of <pb/>public affairs. Their public policy, (if
          they can unite upon any common-platform) will not probably be fully developed before the
          meeting of Congress. It is not however, difficult to foreseee, that upon some measures at
          least, it will be in conflict, with the policy of my administration. The new
          administration, seem to have devoted their time and energies thus far, chiefly, to the
          distribution of the public patronage, among the hords of their partisans who throng
          Washington seeking officcial place. The proscriptive policy, which they are pursuing, does
          not surprise me. From the moment of <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Genl.
              Taylor</name>’</hi>s election, I expressed the opinion, and I believe to yourself
          among others, that if <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Genl. T.</name>
                    </hi> could be
          controlled by the leading members of the Whig party (and I never doubted that he would be)
          his administration would be the most prosciptive, if not vindictive towards its political
          opponents, that had ever existed. Indeed I never knew a <hi rend="italics">professed
            no-party</hi>-<hi rend="italics">party</hi>, or a party who professed great moderation
          before an election, who did not, if they succeeded to power, become proscriptive and
          intollerant, towards their political opponents. But I will indulge in no further
          speculations in reference to these things.</p>
        <p>My heath, which suffered severely, on my return journey homeward, is intirely restored,
          and I am enjoying at my quiet home, in this delightful city, the rest which I so much
          needed. I realize that I am relieved from an immense public responsibility, and that I am
          now as free a citizen, as any in the Union, responsible only to myself, and to the
          <pb/>laws of my country.</p>
        <p>I have postponed a visit to my plantation in <name type="place">Mississippi</name>, until
          October. I hope you will carry out your purpose to visit your plantation at that time, and
          that you will take <name type="place">Nashville</name> in your route. If you will do so I
          will take you down, as far as my place (passing <hi rend="italics">

          your <hi rend="italics">brother’s</hi> and through a delightful region of country, in
          which you would meet many old <name type="place">Virginia</name> frieds. I think you would
          find a visit to <name type="place">Nashville</name> agreeable. You would be warmly
          received by our whole democracy, and indeed I think by our whole people, without
          distinction of party. Our Legislature will be in Session on the <date when="--10-01">1st

          commencement, the annual Meeting of the Masonic fraternity, and a <hi rend="italics">horse-race</hi>, will all take place on the same week, so that as I once jestingly
          remarked to you, you could have a selection of the entertainment which might be most
          agreeable to you. <hi rend="italics">

        <salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>I have not heard from you since I took leave of you at Washington on the <date when="--03-05">5th of March</date>. I saw from the newspapers however, that you were at
          home in time, to contribute (as I have no doubt you did largely), to the gratifying
          success of the Democracy in your State election. Had the gallant <hi rend="italics">Seymour</hi> been chosen Governor, your triumph would have been complete. More
          recently, the <name type="place">Virginia</name> election has taken place, and the result
          has been overwhelming to our political opponents. These elections (in <hi rend="italics">Connecticut</hi> &amp; <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="place">Virginia</name>
                    </hi>), are
          but the commencement of a counter-revolution of the public sentiment, which must end in
          the restoration of the Democratic party to power, four years hence. From all the
          indications, as seen at this distance, I would judge that our successors in the
          administration at Washington, have already serious embarrassments and difficulties to
          encounter. They have, by this time, <pb/>learned, that it is one thing to be <hi rend="italics">out</hi> of power, with the privilege of fault-finding, and quite a
          different thing to be <hi rend="italics">in</hi> power, charged with the conduct of public
          affairs. They seem thus far, to be devoting their time &amp; energies almost exclusively,
          to the distribution of the public patronage, among their political partisans who clamour
          for official place. And after all, they cannot probably satisfy a tithe of the petitioners
          for the “spoils.” Their prosciptive policy does not surprise me. On the contrary, from the
          moment of <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Genl. Taylor</name>
                    </hi>’s election, I
          predicted it. I had no confidence that the <hi rend="italics">no-party</hi> pledges, and
          professions of moderation and liberality towards political opponents, would be kept in
          good faith. Indeed I never knew a professed <hi rend="italics">no party–party</hi> or one
          professing, before an election, to disregard party distinctions, who did not, if they
          succeeded to power, become proscriptive, if not vindictive towards their political
          opponents. The system of public policy of the administration, (if indeed their party can
          unite on any system) will not probably be fully developed, until after the meeting of
          Congress. It is not difficult however to foresee, that upon some vital measures, at least,
          it will be in conflict with the policy of my administration.</p>
        <p>My health suffered severely, during the latter part of my return journey home. It is now
          entirely restored, and I am, at my quiet home in this City, enjoying the rest which I so
          much needed. I have been very kindly and cordially recived by my friends, while no
          asperity of feeling has been manifested among my political opponents, and I am sure that I
          <pb/>am [a]<note place="foot" n="1">Word either absent or missing due to a light ink
            transfer.</note> happier man, now that I am a private citizen, than I was when I held
          power.</p>
        <p>I need scarcely, My Dear Sir: assure you of what, I do not doubt you are already
          satisfied, &amp; that is, that my official &amp; personal intercourse with you, during the
          period you were connected with my administration, was of the most satisfactory and
          agreeable character. I shall ever take a lively interest in your prosprity and success in
          future life. Cannot <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mrs. Toucey</name>

                    </hi> and myself would be delighted to see you at our house. You would meet
          with a warm reception from our whole Democracy. The first of October, is always an
          interesting period here. Our Legislature &amp; Supreme Court meet at that time. The
          college commencement, takes place the same week, so that if you could time your visit to
          be here at that period, you would have an opportunity, of meeting, most of the principal
          men of our state. You have never visited this part of the Union, and I am sure <name type="person">Mrs. T.</name> and yourself would be gratified to see it. Will you make my

        <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
        <p>I recd a letter from <name type="person">Capt. Weems</name> of <name type="place">Hickman</name> reminding me of my promise for us to visit <name type="place">Hickman</name> during this summer and wishing to know the time that will suit our
          convenience and earnestly urging a performance of the promise. If you think it would be
          proper for you to pay the visit in the midst of an electioneering campaign, I will be
          ready to accompany you at any time after the second week in June &amp; shall be most happy
          to do so. From what <name type="person">Weems</name> writes me, I fear that <name type="person">Thomas</name> is in some danger &amp; on that account I feel most anxious
          that we should go, if we can avoid the <hi rend="italics">appearance</hi> of interfereing.
          If you conclude to go, please fix the day &amp; inform me.</p>
        <p>I heard the candidates for Gov. at Springfield and was much disappointed in Brown. His
          assault upon the late Admn. was most puerile &amp; contemptible, if unanswered could have
          done no injury to any one. Trousdale made a sensible speech but was not well informed on
          the various points &amp; rather exceded public expectation. I have never before witnessed
          so much coolness &amp; indifference on elections. The subject is rarely mentioned by
          either party. We know several whigs that will vote for Trousdale in this place &amp; in
          Robertson. Would it not be advisable to make the old issues, the Bank &amp; the Tariff and
          opposition to the <name type="place">Mexican</name>
          <pb/>War more prominent than is done in our papers? I do not see that so much is to be
          made out of Browns position on the Proviso as our friends seem to expect. We learn that
          there is much excitement in the adjoining counties of Kentucky on the question of
          emancipation. The emancipationists will be defeated south of the Green River it is thought
          but doubts are entertained as to the result in the northern parts of the State.</p>
        <p>I have noticed lately the publication of <name type="person">Genl. Houstons</name> letter
          agt. the course of the Admn. in the annexation of Texas addressed to Donelson, which I do
          not remember to have before seen. The practical comments of the Intelligencer induces me
          to mention it, lest it should also have escaped your attention. In any future discussion
          of that question, the letter may be deemed of some importance.</p>
        <p>I intended to have visited Nashville before now but have been so much occupied in
          preparations to live that I have only left the town once since my return.</p>

        <salute>Dear Marshall:</salute>
        <p>I have received your letter of the 1st Instant, in reply to mine written at
            Columbia.<note place="foot" n="1">
                        <name type="person">Polk</name>’s letter, written
            during his visit to <name type="place">Columbia, Tenn.</name>, of <date when="1849-04-04">April 4</date>–<date when="1849-04-16">16, 1849</date>, not
            found.</note> I am glad to learn that your health is good, and that you do not fear the
          result of the approaching examination.</p>
        <p>As soon as you have been examined, you can form a pretty good judgement of your own
          standing in “studies,” in your class, and you must write to me. From what you say, of your
          dislike of <hi rend="italics">Demerit marks</hi>, I hope, now that you have had twelve
          months experience in the Academy, that you will have many fewer of them for the next year,
          than you have had for the present. You speak of going into camp, after the examination as
          the hardest part of your service, but add that you are “not tired of West Point, but like
          it more than ever.” You have “put your hands to the plough and must not look back.” A good
          soldier never faulters or hesitates in the performance of any duty assigned him, however
          perilous or severe it may be. At the end of another year, you will be entitled to a <hi rend="italics">leave of absence</hi>, during the summer vacation, and can visit your
          relations and friends in <name type="place">Tennessee</name> and <name type="place">North
            Carolina</name>. You will enjoy a visit at that time, much more than you could at the
          end of the present year. You should not ask for leave of absence, until by the regulations
          you are entitled to it. In answer to your enquiry, I inform you that your cousin <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Jenny Hays</name>
                    </hi>, returned from <name type="place">Washington</name> with me, and is now at her father’s in <name type="place">Columbia</name>. Your Grand mother, and all your relations are <pb/>in good health, and
          continue to take an interst in your welfare. Tell <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Marshall Walker</name>
                    </hi> that his father was here on yesterday, and that the
          family are all well. Tell <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Marshall</name>
                    </hi> he
          must write to me. We are quietly settled in our new home in this City, and I am enjoying
          the repose and rest, which I so much needed.</p>

        <salute>Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>I have had the honour to receive your letter of the 26th ultimo, inviting me “to attend
          the Annual Show and Exhibition of the New-York <pb/>State Agricultural Society, on the
          11th 12th and 13th days of September next, in the City of Syracuse.” Taking a deep
          interest in the progressive improvement in cultivation, and in the success, and
          prosperity, of the great Agricultural pursuits of our country, in which a majority of our
          people, of all our states, are employed, it would afford me sincere pleasure, to be
          present on the occasion to which you invite me, and to witness the “Annual Show and
          Exhibition” of the farmers of New York; and I have to regret that the distance of my
          residence from Syracuse, and necessary engagements must deprive me of this pleasure.</p>

        <salute>My Dear Sir:</salute>
        <p>I have received your letter of the 23rd Instant. I doubt the propriety of my accepting
          the invitation to visit Hickman, pending the election. I have witnessed so much of the
          arts and tricks of political demagogues, that I am sure they would attempt to misrepresent
          the object of my visit, &amp; to turn it to political account. I would like much, to see
          my old friends in Hickman, and think I may visit <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Capt. Weems</name>
                    </hi>, and the <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="place">Beaver Dam
              Springs</name>
                    </hi> (to which I am also invited)<note place="foot" n="1">Letter not
            found.</note> after the election is over. You are <pb/>differently situated from me.
          Hickman is in your old Congressional District, and has been uniformly steadfast in your
          support. It would be most natural for you to visit your old constituents, and no political
          capital could be made out of it, by our political opponents. I advise you therefore to go
          as you propose. I cannot believe that <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mr
              Thomas</name>
                    </hi> can be in any danger. After the 1st of August I will, if you desire
          it, accompany you to <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="place">Beaver Dam</name>
                    </hi>, <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Weems</name>
                    </hi> &amp;c.</p>
        <p>I think with you, that the old issues of Bank, tariff &amp;c. should be revived in the
          discussions before our people. We have abundant evidence, that the leading men of the Whig
          party throughout the Union, will revive and carry out their old doctrines in relation to
          them, the moment they can command majorities, in the two Houses of Congress, and can
          obtain the sanction of the President. Being perfectly satisfied of this, it is legitimate
          on our part, if not our duty to require our opponents, to avow their purpose, by meeting
          these old issues before the people.</p>
        <p>I have not yet read the letter of <name type="person">Genl. Houston</name>, to <name type="person">Mr Donelson</name>, on the subject of the annexation of Texas, published
          in the Intelligencer, to which you call my attention. I file the Intelligencer &amp; will
          search for it.</p>
        <p>Our successors, seem thus far, to be devoting, their whole time and energies, to the
          distribution, of the public offices, among the hordes of their partisan seekers after
          place. This must truly be regarded as a dignified employment, inasmuch as it seems to
          engross the whole, attention of the Executive Government. They seem to have made but few
          <pb/>developments of their public policy, and probably will not before the meeting of
          Congress. It is however certain that their system of policy, if indeed it shall be
          possible for them to unite upon any common-system, must be in conflict in many important
          respects, with the policy of my administration. I think, the new administration have
          learned by this time, that it is one thing to be <hi rend="italics">out of power</hi> with
          the privilege of fault finding, and quite another thing to be <hi rend="italics">in
            power</hi>, charged with the conduct of public affairs. Their proscriptive policy,
          notwithstanding their solemn pledges before the election, does not surprise me. I
          predicted it to yourself &amp; others, soon after <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Genl. Taylor</name>’s</hi> election was ascertained.</p>
        <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Capt. Hickman</name>
                    </hi> informed me two three
          weeks ago, that you would visit <name type="place">Nashville</name> soon, and I have been
          expecting to see you. We shall be most happy to have a visit from <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Mrs. Johnson</name>
                    </hi> &amp; yourself at our House. We are now settled
          in our new-home, and will be most happy to see our friends, and none of them I assure you,
          with more pleasure than <name type="person">Mrs. J.</name> and yourself.</p>
        <p>There have been a few cases of cholera here within the last week, which have produced
          some excitement among the inhabitants. It is not considerd epidemic &amp; I have heard of
          no case, for a day or two past.</p>
        <p>With the kind respects of <name type="person">Mrs. P.</name> &amp; myself to <name type="person">Mrs. J.</name>. . .</p>

        <p>When we parted in Charleston, you promised to write me on your arrival at <name type="place">Nashville</name>, on the subject of the “Southern Addresses.” It has
          escaped your recollection, &amp; as you may not have read mine, I enclose you a copy,<note place="foot" n="1">Enclosure not found.</note> with the request that you will give me
          your views on the subject. You are aware of the object I have in view, &amp; therefore I
          need not repeat to you the purposes to which I wish to appropriate your letter. Whilst I
          would prefer to receive such a letter as you would be willing I should publish yet I will,
          take it under such restrictions as you see proper to impose upon it, and assure you in
          advance they shall be scrupulously complied with.</p>
        <p>The effort of the Calhoun clique to put down those of us, who would not follow their
          utopian leader, ought to be met, promptly and energetically, &amp; <hi rend="italics">shall be</hi>, so far as I am concerned. If in this purpose I can be sustained by the
          leading &amp; reliable men of the party, I have no fear of the result. The people of this
          section of the country are with me, and I desire to built them up in the faith, by
          exhibiting to them the evidence, of my course being sustained by those, who have their
          confidences to the unlimited extent, which it is your good fortune to possess it. The
          preservation of the democratic party of the Union, is not only the safety of the Union
          itself, but also the surest safeguard for the <pb/>rights of the south. If so; it is a

        <salute>Dear Sir</salute>
        <p>Allow me to request that you will deliberately examine the enclosed article on the
          subject of slavery &amp; abolition, of which I am the author.<note place="foot" n="1">Enclosure not found. Darby probably enclosed one or more of the six articles and one
            letter that he had written, under the pseudonym “Moses,” for the Louisville (Ky.) <hi rend="italics">Examiner</hi>, <date when="1848-12-02">December 2</date>, <date when="1848-12-16">16</date>, and <date when="1848-12-30">30, 1848</date>, and <date when="1849-01-06">January 6</date>, <date when="1849-01-20">20</date>, and <date when="1849-02-27">27</date> and <date when="1849-02-24">February 24, 1849</date>. That
            newspaper’s editors opposed slavery, and after the Kentucky legislature in <date when="1849-01">January 1849</date> called for a constitutional convention to meet in
            October, abolition there seemed possibile. Darby argues that God created racial
            differences and decreed Africans’ enslavement by North American whites to bring them
            civilization and Christianity and thus to enable them to enter heaven. Using biblical
            and scientific evidence, he maintains slavery’s necessity for years or centuries to
            come. Abolition in Kentucky now, he asserts, would harm blacks by triggering their sale
            to harsher masters farther south and “would . . . lead to a civil war and a dissolution of
            the Union” (<date when="--01-27">January 27</date>), a consequence he blames on Northern
            extremists. He condemns, however, the legislature’s <date when="1849-02">February
              1849</date> decision to reverse an <date when="1833">1833</date> ban on the
            importation of slaves, describing blacks’ presence (but not their enslavement) as “the
            evil” (<date when="--02-24">February 24</date>).</note>
                </p>
        <p>I can not omit this opportunity as an American citizen to express to you the great
          obligations I feel under to you for the services which you so wisely &amp; so nobly
          rendered our country during the four years that it pleased the Ruler of the Universe, in
          mercy, to make you the President of <pb/>the United States. It is no flattery now to say
          that my deliberate opinion is that the names of <name type="place">Washington</name>,
            <name type="person">Jefferson</name>, <name type="person">Jackson</name>, &amp; <name type="person">Polk</name> are to go down to future generations as the greatest &amp; the

                    <pb/>Dear Sir/</salute>
        <p>Your mother is quite sick. She has been complaining for several days of Cholic—Yesterday
          she had a chill &amp; very high fever, &amp; is threatened with a severe spell. Jennie
          Pickett also, has been very ill for several days—worms we suppose. She has violent &amp;
          alarming spasms &amp; requires almost constantly the attention of her Grandmother, as Mary
          is in a condition &amp; becomes so much excited when she has a spasm that she cannot do
          what is necessary. This renders it out of Maria’s power to pay that particular attention
          to her mother which she needs.</p>
        <p>If your mother should get worse I will Telegraph you to-day or at any time that she may
          become so. If better I will write you again to-morrow.</p>

                    <pb/>Dear Sir/</salute>
        <p>I tried to send a dispatch to <name type="person">Dr. Hays</name> yesterday, but the
          Telegraph wires broke &amp; it could not be sent. I hope they are repaired by this time
          &amp; shall as soon as I finish this letter go down &amp; try again.</p>
        <p>Your mother is much better, indeed I may say except debility she is well. She has had no
          fever since <name type="person">Dr. Hays</name> left—has got out of bed, can take her
          Coffee &amp; smoke her pipe. We were very uneasy about <name type="person">Jennie
            Pickett</name> yesterday morning—she had a severe spasm with much pain, she has had none
          since—her medicine has worked kindly &amp; she is this morning very decidedly better.
          There is nothing in her case, or your mothers, that requires <name type="person">Dr.
            Hays</name>’s attention &amp; we think he had better stay with you until you
          recover.</p>
        <p>I have made some discoveries worth a few hundred dollars to <name type="person">Marshall
            Polk</name>. I will explain to you, when you get well enough to attend to it. I mention
          it now that you may call my attention to it.</p>

        <salute>Hon J. K Polk,</salute>
        <p>I have taken the Liberty of sending you by mail to day our paper the Pennsylvanian for
          your perusal; in it, are remarks that would do no harme to be copyd into your papers, as
          your election I find is coming on.<note place="foot" n="1">The newspaper that <name type="person">Harris</name> sent <name type="person">Polk</name> has not been found.
            If he sent the Philadelphia <hi rend="italics">
                            <name type="place">Pennsylvanian</name>
                        </hi> of <date when="1849-06-08">June 8, 1849</date>, he most
            likely refers to to an editorial titled “Political Coalitions.” It forecasts, “In a few
            short months, this agitation about slavery will settle itself; and we perceive that the
            people of California have already moved . . . to dispose of the question in their own way.
            The result of their action in the premises, cannot fail to extinguish all the excitement
            which has grown out of the subject.” The Democratic paper accuses Whigs of hypocrisy for
            criticizing, in the Philadelphia <hi rend="italics">North American and United States
              Gazette</hi>, a proposed alliance in Vermont between the Democratic and Free Soil
            parties, but running a gubernatorial candidate in <name type="place">Alabama</name>,
              <name type="person">James E. Belser</name>, with Democratic political positions—an
            alliance, like that in Vermont, to win “‘the spoils of office.’”</note> We wish our
          congressional was to take place at the same time, as I <pb/>assure you from present
          prospects, we would elect every man. The present course of <hi rend="italics">
                        <name type="person">Taylor</name>
                    </hi>, is of vast advantage to the Democracy of this, and I
          think every state in the <hi rend="italics">Union</hi>; The peoples eyes are certainly
          opened, and I venture to predict, that the Ballot Box will tell the tale. I rejoice to
          find from the <name type="place">Nashville</name> paper that your health has grately
          improved, since your retirement from the Peoples gift.<note place="foot" n="2">Despite his
            reference to “the Nashville paper,” Harris may refer to a short item in the <hi rend="italics">Pennsylvanian</hi> of <date when="--06-08">June 8</date>, “<name type="person">Hon. James K. Polk</name>,” which summarizes the second half of <name type="person">Polk</name> to <name type="person">John W. Forney</name>, <date when="1849-05-09">May 9, 1849</date>.</note>
                </p>
        <p>And have no doubt, you are glad to settle down in that sweet calm piece, that allways
          follows from discharging our <hi rend="italics">duties</hi>. I have never had the pleasure
          of knowing you personally, allthoug frequently shaking hands. I never applyed for any
          office, and never wished any; I am therefore perfectedly free in my political sentiments;
          my first vote was for <name type="person">James Monroe</name>, and my last was for Lewis
          Cass, and in the convention that nominated <name type="person">J K Polk</name>; I was
          among the <hi rend="italics">first</hi>, that said <hi rend="italics">Amen</hi>. I had
          seen you in the speakers chair; and saw the immortal <hi rend="italics">Hickory</hi>;
          flash from your Eyes. And when the time came, I marched to the Poles with my <hi rend="italics">sons</hi> and deposited our votes for your Excellency.</p>
        <p>Which we all have never regretted, but would have done so again if you had been the
          Democratic nominee.</p>
        <p>I really look round with grate, and gratefull emotions of Joy, to see how handsomely you
          have conducted the ship of state, and the delightfull ground in which you left her riding
          anchor. It is impossible to move her <hi rend="italics">therefrom</hi>; providence, and
          the God of providence protects her with his smiles of approbation (therefore, she cant be
          moved).</p>
        <p>
                    <pb/>If ever I come to Nashville where we sell goods to merchants; I intend to give you a
          call, and look at the place where <hi rend="italics">Old Hicory lies</hi>.</p>
        <p>Wishing from my hart a continuance of good health to you and yours; with a long life if
          providence permits . . . .</p>
